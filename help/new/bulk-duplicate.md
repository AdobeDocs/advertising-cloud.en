# Bulk Duplicate {#bulk-duplicate}

Our bulk duplication tool enables advertisers to quickly take existing campaigns, placements or packages -- and replicate them once or multiple times. The tool also allows users to modify certain parameters of each shell and set new destinations before executing the duplication.

The platform will run the duplication tasks in the background and users will be able to maneuver throughout the platform and perform other tasks. Check the status reporter to view progress of all bulk actions currently still in progress. Once the duplication is complete, users will be able to apply additional Bulk Tools such as Bulk Edit to modify more granular parameters and settings.

* Custom Ad Weighting and Scheduling if ads are not attached.
* Associated Direct Deals
* Social placements are unable to be copied.
* If copied to a different campaign: Geo-fencing, Pixels, Ads, DoubleVerify Authentic Custom Brand Safety Segments, Survey control placement id.
* Experiment Settings won't be copied.
