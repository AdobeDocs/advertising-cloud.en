# Google Ad Rejection {#google-ad-rejection}

If at any time during your campaign your ad gets rejected, here are a few troubleshooting tricks to solve the problem:

* Check the ad duration of your creative. If it exceeds the max duration of the ad slot, the ad will be rejected.
* Declared advertiser URL must match the domain of the click through url.

    * When creating a campaign, make sure to choose the correct advertiser url. If this does not match the click through url the ad will be rejected.
