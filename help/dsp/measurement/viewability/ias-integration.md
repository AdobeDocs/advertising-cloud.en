# IAS Viewability {#ias-viewability}

IAS or Integral Ad Science is a 3rd party viewability verification reporting integrated within Advertising Cloud DSP.  While Viewability reporting is standard and free with any pre-roll placement, IAS offers scalable, independent reporting and vets Advertising Cloud DSP as an independent DSP.

With its sophisticated TRAQ verification, IAS scores viewability on an impression level in addition to scoring for other metrics including fraud, brand safety, professionalism and page clutter. By leveraging Advertising Cloud DSP BrandSafe fraud protection, including pre-bid blocking of botnets and fake pre-roll, optimization is simple with IAS's viewability metrics to run on more favorable site environments.
