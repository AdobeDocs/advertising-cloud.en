# Edit Attribute Tags

<!-- Is this for any private inventory deal type, or only for smart ad serving deals? The deal type isn't shown in the Deals UI, so I can't tell. --> 

After you've created a private inventory deal, you can change the attribute tags for the deal.

1. In the main menu, click **Inventory > Deals**. 
1. In the right column for the deal, click ![Edit](/help/dsp/assets/edit.png) and select **edit tags**.
1. Do any of the following:
    * To create a new tag and associate it with the deal, enter the attribute tag name in the **Enter new tag(s)** field, and then click **Create & Associate Tag**.
    * To change the tags associated with the deal, select or deselect the check boxes next to the tag names in the Custom Tags section.
1. Click **Update**.
