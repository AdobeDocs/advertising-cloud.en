# Overview of Inventory Features in Advertising Cloud DSP

Advertising Cloud DSP can support your inventory needs, whether you’re wanting to find scale with public inventory, find scale among premium publishers with On Demand, or set up a 1:1 private marketplace (PMP) deal with a publisher to activate against specific audiences or sites. Your campaign goals will help dictate which type of inventory best suits your campaign’s performance needs. Integrations with top supply side platforms (SSPs) allow seamless setup and activation of your PMPs.

Once you access or identify your inventory deals in DSP, you can use them as placement targets for your campaigns.

## Available Inventory Types

### On Demand Inventory

Explore pre-negotiated, non-guaranteed deals that Adobe has curated with our premium publisher partners. You can access inventory from the top publishers in-region without the need for 1:1 negotiations or contracts.

### Private Inventory

Set up and manage private marketplace deals (PMPs), which are deals that you've negotiated directly 1:1 with the publisher, so that one or more advertisers in your account can target them. Execute these deals via deal IDs or VAST (Video Ad Serving Template) tags. You can set up non-guaranteed PMPs or set up programmatic guaranteed (PG) deals IDs with select SSPs.

### Simple Ad Serving

Simple Ad Serving is streamlined technology for guaranteed, non-decisioned ad delivery and reporting. Use Simple Ad Serving when your publisher can't execute your deal via deal IDs. All targeting, budget pacing and capping, and frequency capping is handled by the publisher. Execute these deals via ad tags or event pixels.
