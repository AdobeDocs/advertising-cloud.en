# Accept a Deal in the Deal ID Inbox

*Users in [!DNL DSP] Accounts that Are Mapped to SSP Accounts Only*

Use the Deal ID Inbox to quickly accept a private deal you've already negotiated with a publisher on Google Authorized Buyers, FreeWheel.

>[!NOTE]

>Setting up programmatic guaranteed deals with publishers on FreeWheel requires extra permissions and steps. See "[Overview of Setting up Programmatic Guaranteed Deals in FreeWheel](freewheel-overview.md)" for more information.

1. In the main menu, click **Inventory > Deals.**

1. Above the list of Deals, click the blue bar to open the deal ID inbox.

1. (Optional) To refresh the deal details, click **Refresh**.

   DSP automatically refreshes all deal details daily at 4:30 a.m. EST. It also refreshes all FreeWheel deals and updates existing deals from Google and Rubicon hourly.

1. (If you previously ignored the deal) Click the **Ignored Deals** tab.

1. To review and confirm the deal details, such as the publisher and dates, hold the cursor over the deal row and click ![Review](/help/dsp/assets/review.png).

1. Do either of the following:

    * In the deal details, click **Accept**.

    * In the Deal ID inbox, hold the cursor over the deal row and click ![Accept](/help/dsp/assets/accept.png).

1. In the deal details:
    1. Complete the required information: **Publisher**, **Media Type**, and **Deal Access** (the advertisers who will have access to the deal).
    1. (Optional) Specify additional accounts with which to share the deal or attach labels to the deal record.

    1. Click **Save**.
    
1. (Programmatic guaranteed deals only) Follow the prompts to select an ad for the deal and create a programmatic guaranteed default placement that targets the deal.

Once you accept a deal, it's moved from the deal ID inbox to the Inventory > Deals view, and the deal is available as a private inventory source in each placement's Inventory Targeting section.
