# Subscribe and Request Access to On Demand Premium Inventory Deals

*Not available to users with the account types Ad Network, Publisher Audience Extension, and Other; advertisers with the category Other; and resellers*

You can request individual deals or subscribe to a publisher to request all of the publisher's deals. When you subscribe to a publisher, DSP automatically requests any new deals that the publisher offers, on your behalf.

Once a deal is [approved](/help/dsp/inventory/on-demand-inventory-view-status.md), it's included by default as a target for new placements that target all On Demand Inventory. The new deal is also available as a target for existing placements, but you need to manually edit the placement settings to add the deal as a target.
