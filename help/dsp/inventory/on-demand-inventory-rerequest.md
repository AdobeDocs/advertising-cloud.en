You can re-request On Demand Inventory deals for which you were denied, including deals from a publisher to which you're subscribed. Follow these steps to make sure that all applicable account settings are correct before you submit a new request.

If a deal isn't approved after you re-request it, contact your Adobe account manager to see if the publisher has additional restrictions that prohibit your account from accessing the deal.

Once a deal is [approved](/help/dsp/inventory/on-demand-inventory-view-status.md), it's included by default as a target for new placements that target all On Demand Inventory. The new deal is also available as a target for existing placements, but you need to manually edit the placement settings to add the deal as a target.
