# About [!UICONTROL Simple Ad Serving]

[!UICONTROL Simple Ad Serving] provides non-decisioned, guaranteed ad delivery and reporting for a specified publisher and a single ad type using a single, dedicated placement.

With [!UICONTROL Simple Ad Serving], each ad is served directly by the publisher (site serve), and DSP provides an event-tracking pixel to send to the publisher, who needs to implement the pixel and traffic the DSP ads. Depending on the inventory type, the event pixels measure impression, clickthrough, and video played events.

The following ad types are available:

* desktop standard pre-roll
* tablet and mobile standard pre-roll
* connected TV standard pre-roll

You can create a [!UICONTROL Simple Ad Serving] deal in the [!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals] view. DSP automatically generates a zero-level placement for the ad, targeting the deal but without the option for additional targeting, budget, or frequency capping. You can edit only some of the deal settings, such as the deal name, CPM, impressions, and flight dates.<!-- If you need multiple tracking tags for a [!UICONTROL Simple Ad Serving] deal, create a duplicate deal. -->

[!UICONTROL Simple Ad Serving] placements don't comply with the account's usable funds or the campaign and package budgets. However, spend is tracked and counted toward those budgets. Even when the CPM is $0, event data is always tracked.
