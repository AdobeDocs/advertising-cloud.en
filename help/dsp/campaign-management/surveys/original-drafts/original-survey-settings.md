# Survey Settings {#survey-settings}

<!-- Fill in the rest and add more information as needed. -->

<!-- If the settings vary much by survey type, then create a subheading (##) for each survey type. If there are only a few differences, then all can go in the same list, with "(XXX ads only)" for the fields that don't apply to everything.-->

<!-- When a maximum number of characters is allowed, or there any restrictions on the type of characters allowed, include that (such as "The maximum length is 15 characters.") -->

<!-- Also, note which settings are read-only or not available when you go back in to view or edit the settings later -->
