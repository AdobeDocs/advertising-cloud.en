# Best Practices for Optimizing Surveys {#survey-best-practices-optimization}
## Survey Optimization
1. Once your survey is live and you have delivered a reasonable number of impressions, you should look at optimizing the survey placements to increase your respondents and reduce your overall survey cost. When running media placements, it is up to you to decide your KPI based on the campaign's goals. 
    * Optimizing towards viewable impressions alongside player size: Since you pay per impression rather than per response, it is important for your survey to be highly viewable to increase your response rate.
    * We recommend pushing more inventory towards player sizes greater than 300x250. 
     * At the site level, consider optimizing towards survey starts and completes.  If you find that there are sites consuming impressions but not resulting in a survey completion, eliminate said site and focus the campaign on inventory resonating well with the end target.

### Additional Recommendations: 
1. We recommend that you collect at least 200 responses per group you are surveying. 
    * For example, if you are doing a Brand Lift or Creative Impact study, you should have at least 200 responses for each group, or 400 total. 
    * At this sample size, you’re more likely to see statistically significant differences between the groups you’re surveying. 
    * How long it takes to get these many responses depends on who and where your target respondent is. The larger the target audience, budget, and bid, the faster you will collect responses. If you are retargeting viewers for the survey, you will need to budget lead time to start building a pool of respondents.
1. We recommend starting your bid around $25 USD. 
1. Writing the right questions. Asking the right questions is essential for survey success. Here are our Top 5 Tips for writing questions that will help yield the best results:
    * Define your goals. Whether or not your survey is related to an ongoing campaign, make sure you have defined KPIs for your research. This will not only help you write the best questions, but also to interpret the results down the road.
    * Avoid complexity. It’s tempting to put a lot of questions or complex answer choices into a survey but try to keep it simple by having a clear focus and using concise language.
    * Consider the creative. Especially if you’re running a Brand Lift or Creative Impact study, asking about a message or branding goal associated with the creative is key to crafting the right question.
#### Survey Users Exposed Across Various Formats: 
1. Desktop 
1. Mobile (App vs. Web)
    1. Mobile Web delivery collects Mobile Cookies, which means the user can only be re-targeted again in Mobile web. Due to poor user experience (small screens) we tend to see very low response rates in mobile web if any at all. Our recommendation is to shift mobile web media delivery to desktop and / or Mobile App to ensure you can measure the exposure. 
#### Note: If a campaign is both desktop and mobile, you can create identical desktop & mobile surveys and combine results at the end of a campaign. IF you run the surveys the same, and you ask the same questions on both desktop and mobile.
