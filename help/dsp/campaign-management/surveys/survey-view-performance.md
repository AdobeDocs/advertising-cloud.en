#### Reporting on The Results
1. One of the main advantages of running Surveys with Adobe Advertising Cloud is the ability to see results in real-time. 
  1. To see a comparison of the responses between the exposed and control group, go to the exposed placement and click on the placement name.
  1. You are now in the Survey reports page. Some key stats you want to look at are Brand Lift, Respondents and the bar chart which will give you a visual representation of your Survey results.

**Note:** 
  * The difference between respondent and responses:
    *	Respondent is one person who answered all questions 
    *	Responses is the number of answers someone provided. This includes any positive responses for questions that allow multiple answers.
      *	You can also go to the survey tab, hit the gear and select report to get the overall results (show graphic) 
      *	To view results by exposed group, letâ€™s say if you did an audience test, you need to open each individual exposed placement on a separate tab.
