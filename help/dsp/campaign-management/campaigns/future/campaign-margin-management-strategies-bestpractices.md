# Margin Management

See existing docs on fixed and dynamic margin management in INTRO and decide where the info goes. Maybe the intro includes a brief blurb, but then we create a separate file with more details, including a table or something outlining the pros and cons of each and when to use. Maybe that should be its own file, or maybe the info. should go into in the overall best practices doc.

Or should the intro include all the info? Can go either way with the intro.
