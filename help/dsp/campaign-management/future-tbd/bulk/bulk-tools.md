# Bulk Tools

<!-- pulled directly from old help -->

Save time creating and editing placements using bulk tools.

## Attach Multiple Ads to Placements:{#attach-multiple-ads-to-placements}

Never attach the same ad one by one to multiple placements, or the same placement assigned one at a time to multiple ads ever again. Weâ€™ve now simplified the process so you can easily select multiple ads/placements to attach in bulk, saving you a significant amount of time and energy! Access this feature from the ad or placement section, via the gear on the right hand side.

>[!NOTE]
>You can attach a maximum of 20 items at a time.
