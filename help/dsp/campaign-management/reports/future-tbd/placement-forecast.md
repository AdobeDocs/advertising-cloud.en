# Placement Forecasts

Placements with placement-level pacing only (?). Only available for some placement types, I think. What other caveats?

In placement settings, right column (alongside settings)

Will populate with the estimated delivery based on the specified budget goal.

>[!NOTE]
>
> For Roku placements, forecasting is available only when the Max Bid is at least $35 and at least one Roku deal or source is selected (targeted, or can you just exclude one deal?).
