# Placement Forecasts

Placements with placement-level pacing only (?). Only available for some placement types, I think. What other caveats?

In placement settings, right column (alongside settings)

Includes a) an "Estimated Delivery" section which indicates the estimated delivery based on the specified budget goal and current targeting configuration and b) an "Estimated Maximums" section indicates how much more capacity is available with the specified budget goal and current targeting configuration.

>[!NOTE]
>
> For Roku placements, forecasting is available only when the Max Bid is at least $35 and at least one Roku deal or source is selected (targeted, or can you just exclude one deal?).
