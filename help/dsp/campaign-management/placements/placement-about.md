# About Placement Management in Advertising Cloud DSP

A placement includes targeting parameters for one or more ads of the same ad type. You can create a placement for a single campaign or package, and then assign ads to it. Each campaign or placement can include multiple placements, with a specified ad rotation. By default, ads are rotated evenly.

Once you assign an active placement to an active package or campaign, then all active, approved ads in the placement are eligible to run based on the placement targeting parameters.

You can create a placement manually or by duplicating an existing one. You can also create placement templates to reuse, either manually or from an existing placement. You can attach additional ads to any placement. You can also edit, pause, or archive individual placements or use the bulk edit tool to make changes. <!-- Nicola had included "delete," but I don't see that command in context menu or in settings. -->

## Available Placement Types

* Pre-Roll
* Mobile
* Display
* Surveys

## The Placements Dashboard

The Placements dashboard centralizes performance and economic reporting across all of your placements, providing quick snapshots of how your placements have performed during a specified date range.

The dashboard includes a high-level, customizable trend chart with three metrics.

The dashboard also shows pacing and delivery metrics by placement, by default. You can optionally view performance metrics for the placements, and create custom column sets. You can download the entire data table to your browser's default download folder as a report in XLSM (macro-enabled Excel spreadsheet) format.

For each placement, you can open a detail view ([Inspector](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-reports-about.md)), which includes performance metrics, pacing and delivery metrics, and custom column sets by site and by ad; and frequency metrics. You can also take quick actions on the included sites and ads, like excluding a site or pausing an ad. To open the Inspector, hold the cursor over the placement row, click **More**, and then click **Sites**, **Ads**, or **Frequency**. You can export the data on the Sites, Ads, or Frequency tab to your browser's default download folder as a report in XLSM format.
