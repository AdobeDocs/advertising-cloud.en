# Quickly Edit Key Placement Settings

<!-- Some placements don't have this option. Clarify which placement types aren't eligible -- is it PG and simple ad serving placements, or all placements using private inventory? And anything else? -->

You can edit the placement name, status, maximum bid, and budget without opening the complete placement settings.
