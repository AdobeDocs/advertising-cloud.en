# Duplicate an Ad

You can duplicate an ad within the same campaign.

1. In the main menu, click **Campaigns**.
1. Click the name of the campaign.
1. In the submenu, click **Ads**.
1. Next to the ad name, click  **... > Duplicate**.
1. Specify the new ad settings:
    1. (Optional) Change the default ad name. By default, the new ad is called "Copy of \<*original ad name*\>."
    1. (Optional) Change the [ad settings](ad-settings.md).
1. Click **Save & Submit for Review**.

   The [ad review](ad-about.md) for the new ad takes 24-48 hours and includes checks for sensitive categories, click URL functionality, and preview rendering. The Status column indicates whether the ad has been approved. Broken ads may have a pending status for longer than 24-48 hours so you have time to fix errors before they're rejected.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Your ad will only be served if both DSP and the SSP have approved the creative. Each SSP has its own approval requirements and process.
