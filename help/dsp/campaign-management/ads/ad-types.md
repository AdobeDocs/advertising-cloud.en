# Available Ad Types

All of the following ad types are available in Advertising Cloud DSP for [third-party-served ads](/help/dsp/campaign-management/ads/ad-create-multiple.md).

For full specifications for each ad type, see the [Ad Specifications](/help/dsp/assets/ad-specs.pdf).

## Audio Ads

Audio ads play between content on digital publisher sites and can be run standalone as audio files or along with companion banners. Audio is best used to drive brand awareness and engage with on-the-go audiences. Key performance indicators for audio include [!UICONTROL Completion Rate] and [!UICONTROL Cost per Completion].

## Display Ads

Display ads are animated or static images displayed in web browsers or in apps. Clicking on the ad unit takes the user to a branded site or microsite. Display is best used to drive efficient CPMs, increase message association, add additional brand or product touchpoints, and drive users down the purchase funnel. Key performance indicators for display include [!UICONTROL Clicks], [!UICONTROL Cost per Click], [!UICONTROL Conversions], and [!UICONTROL Cost per Conversion]. DSP supports a wide variety of display banner ad sizes.

## Mobile Ads

Mobile ads can be in pre-roll video (VAST, MRAID) or standard display format. Mobile pre-roll video can be auto-play or click-to-play and is best used for reaching viewers across screens. Mobile standard display is a static image displayed on mobile web browsers or in apps and is best used to complement digital video buys, drive message association, and add additional branding or product touchpoints. Mobile ads can also function as full-screen takeovers or as mobile interstitials, which are full-screen, high-impact mobile ads that are best used to develop brand awareness for mobile audiences and drive conversions.

## Native Ads

Native ads are supported in standard display format. Native ads include a headline and/or title, description, logo, and image. The ad elements are combined and rendered to match the publisher's page style so that the ad blends in with the publisher's organic content and drives higher engagement. Native is best used for brand awareness and for driving audience view and engagement rates with viewer-friendly advertising. Key performance indicators include [!UICONTROL Clicks], [!UICONTROL Cost Per Click], [!UICONTROL Conversions], and [!UICONTROL Cost Per Conversion].

## Pre-roll Ads

Pre-roll ads (VAST and VPAID) are shown before premium video content and provide an immersive, engaging viewer experience. Pre-roll video can be interactive, contain rich media features, and include overlays, rollovers, and calls-to-action. Key performance indicators for pre-roll video ads include [!UICONTROL Video Completion Rate] and [!UICONTROL Viewability Rate].

## Connected TV Ads

Connected TV ads are shown before and during premium TV video content. All connected TV inventory runs on TV devices, meaning that video plays automatically in a lean-back, full-screen environment that viewers can't skip. Connected TV is the closest digital video format to TV commercials. Key performance indicators for Connected TV include [!UICONTROL Completion Rate].
