# About Activating Authenticated Segments from Audience Sources

<!-- Doesn't specifically explain what you can do in our UI -->
*Beta feature*

Advertising Cloud DSP can ingest first-party segments comprised of authenticated signals built within a customer data platform (CDP), which you can use as targets for your placements.

[Destinations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/home.html) in [!DNL Adobe Real-time Customer Data Profile (CDP)](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/rtcdp/overview.html) are connections with external platforms that allow seamless data activation from Adobe Experience Platform. For example, you can use destinations to activate your known customer relationships (such as hashed email addresses) for targeted advertising across digital formats supported by DSP.   

See the Adobe Experience Platform [Destinations Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/home.html) for more information, including an overview of the product, instructions for [creating destination workspaces](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/destinations-workspace.html)and [creating destination connections](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/connect-destination.html), and [activating data to destinations](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/destinations/ui/activate/activate-segment-streaming-destinations.html).
