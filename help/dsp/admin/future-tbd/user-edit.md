# Edit User Permissions or Delete a User

<!-- It looks like the account owner can't change his/her own permissions. Probably a superuser has to do that.-->

<!-- I don't see the ability to change which advertisers the user has access to, so I guess that all advertisers in the account are available to all of the users. Verify if only the account owner can edit/delete users. -->

*Administrator Users Only*
