# View Linked Accounts for Cross-Account Reporting

<!-- written by Shay -->
<!-- already added a "Cross-Account Reporting" section to "About Custom Reports," and the "Add Filter" for Account info in "Custom Report Settings." This just needs to be info. on viewing your linked accounts. And add cross-references to this from the other places. -->
Cross Account reporting is available for any client who has DSP multiple accounts. To enable this feature contact your account team. You configure any of your accounts so they are able to include data from other accounts. Note that this can be bi-directional but does not have to be. For example you can choose to give Account A the ability to include data from Account B. But not allow Account B to have access to Account A.

Using Cross Account reporting

Once an account has been enabled with access to other accounts, any user in an account will see an Account filter in [custom report settings](/help/dsp/reports/report-settings.md). This filter is enabled for any of the supported report templates (Custom, Site, Segment, Geo, Device, Frequency by Impression and Conversion).

Viewing Cross-Account linkages

Users with admin permissions can view details about account linkage in the Account summary page. Also, any child accounts will be visible in the Account menu in the Custom Reports page.

To view parent and child linkages:

(Read-only)

Click 'Admin' in the left nav of the platform
Then click 'My Account' in the top nav.
Then click 'View' next to "Linked accounts"
The page has two lists. One showing which accounts this account has access to. The other showing which accounts have access to this account.
