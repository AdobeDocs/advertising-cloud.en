# On Demand Placement {#on-demand-placement}

Now that you've gained access to all the On Demand premium publishers you'd like to work with, we've created a placement that allows you to target all that inventory at once.

1. Go to the "Inventory Sources" section of a placement and select the option to **Optimize to use On Demand Inventory only**.

    Make sure that **Public Inventory** is deselected and that **Private Inventory** is selected.

1. Confirm the site targeting. To maximize scale and performance, we recommend selecting "Add All Sites."

1. Click **Save & Close**.
 
>[!NOTE]
>
>* When you use the Max Bid feature, the placement will automatically populate a default CPM to clear the most expensive feed (or inventory source). This max bid is only a suggestion. If the price is too high, feel free to adjust to the necessary price point. To get a range of different inventory sources and maximize the diversity of delivery, create multiple On Demand placements with different max bids.
> * Make sure to specify the appropriate geographical locations for the placement.
