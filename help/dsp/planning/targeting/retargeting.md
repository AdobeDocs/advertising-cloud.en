# Retargeting {#retargeting}

Our Custom Segments feature allows you to [create a retargeting pixel](retargeting/retargeting-pixel-setup.md) to collect your own first-party audience data. You can use the pixel in the following ways:

* Track site visitors to retarget – Place the pixel on the brand's website, ideally at least two weeks before the campaign's start date.  The pixel fires when the page is loaded and stores a cookie pool of website visitors.
* Track video viewers to retarget – Attach the pixel to a live video or display ad. The pixel fires when the ad is viewed and stores a cookie pool of ad viewers.
* Create cookie pools – Add the pixel to video ads to create groups of video viewers across campaigns (such as “auto video viewers” or “holiday video viewers").
* Identify control groups and exposed groups for [surveys](../../../dsp/planning/brandsights.md) – Attach the pixel to all video ads in a campaign to identify the “exposed” group, which are the viewers who were exposed to the online video campaign.

You can include the pixel in the audience set for any placement.
