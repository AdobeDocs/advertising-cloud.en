# Contextual {#contextual}

<!-- Need to completely rewrite this base on current UI. -->

You can target contextual site lists that combine site targeting with other types of targeting, such as specified locations, (mobile ads only) devices, topic targets, brand safety and media quality options, and so on.

<!-- The Sitelist tool doesn't exist anymore, so see if any of this is relevant and/or if new info. needs to be rewritten.  -->

## Relevant filters for your site list

* Search for sites by URL or keywords.
* Select sites based on categories or subcategories
* Select site quality by [tier](../../../dsp/planning/brand-safety/sitesafe-quality.md).
* Target and block sites using contextual filters from ComScore, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science, and Peer 39.
* Block bids to fraudulent and suspicious sites and devices using categories from  DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science, and Peer 39.
