## Custom Segments

This tool also allows you to access to target first-party data segments in two ways:

* You can collect cookies within the platform by [creating a retargeting pixel](retargeting/retargeting-pixel-setup.md) and [retargeting](retargeting.md) users.

* You can load your own DMP data into Advertising Cloud DSP with the help of your Account Manager.

{!TIP]
>
>* Behavioral targeting isn't recommended for tightly-targeted campaigns (for example, for audiences within specific DMAs or zipcodes or for dayparting).
>* Segments ideally should include at least 10M users.
>* Using third-party segments incurs an additional data cost. Check the Audience tool for pricing.
