# Launch Checklist {#launch-checklist}

## Account Funding
  
Make sure your account has enough credit to run the entire placement. You can refill and   
check funding in the “My Account” section in the upper right hand corner or contact your Account Manager for a higher credit limit.   

## Campaign Status
  
Confirm that the Advertiser URL and Campaign Budget Cap are correct.

## Placement Status
  
Make sure the placement is set to live (green) in the Placement dashboard. Check your placement parameters (site list, budget, goal, flight dates, frequency etc) and verify that they are correct.   

## Ad Status
  
Click on the Ad button underneath the placement title and check that ads are attached, approved   
and live.

## Pixels
 
In your ads, click the Pixel tab and verify that the pixels are attached and firing.
