# Packages Dashboard {#packages-dashboard}

The [Packages](campaign-setup/packages.md) Dashboard centralizes performance and economic reporting across all of your package strategies, providing quick snapshots of how your campaigns are performing.

The dashboard includes a high-level overview of your campaign metrics, customizable date ranges, and the ability to create a new package.

It also shows campaign performance by package. Every package has a placement or group of placements that are tied together by a shared delivery goal. In this section you can search across your packages or filter by Goal Type. As the page updates based on your selection, the graph and high level metrics at the top of the page will also update to quickly determine how each package influences your overall campaign strategy.

Package-level metrics provide you with real-time information on pacing, delivery, and performance across each strategy. Package Name, Pacing & Time Elapsed, Today's Goal, and Yesterday's (YD) Delivery columns are always included, but you can edit the remaining five columns using the drop down menu on the right.

In the Pacing & Time Elapsed section, the pacing bar indicates how you are performing against your goal. If the bar is red, then you are behind, and if it is blue, then you are ahead. For in-depth details for the package, hold the cursor over the pacing bar.

To see all the placements within each package, click the package name to return to the placement page with the appropriate package filter applied.

You can download the entire data table to your browser's default download folder as a report in XLSM (macro-enabled Excel spreadsheet) format.
