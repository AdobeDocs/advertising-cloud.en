# Packages {#packages}

Packages are groups of placements with common goals for easier management and measurement. You can create a package at either the [campaign level](../../../user-guide/execution/campaign-setup.md) or the placement level.

To ensure that all packages are tracking properly, make sure to assign every placement to the appropriate package.
