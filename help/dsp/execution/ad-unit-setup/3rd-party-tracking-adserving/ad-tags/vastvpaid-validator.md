# VAST/VPAID Validator {#vast-vpaid-validator}

The VAST tag validator automatically scans a third-party ad tag during the upload or video selection process:

Once the validation is complete, you will see a VAST Tag Errors & Warnings modal indicating any potential issues with your ad tag.

[ ![Validator Errors](assets/validator-errors.png)](assets/validator-errors.png)

If no errors are found, a green checkmark is added next to your tag URL.

Below is a list of possible warning and error messages. The only message that will prevent you from saving the ad tag is "Missing mandatory objects in the VAST tag".  Most warnings are related to preventing delivery, tracking or video playback quality issues.
