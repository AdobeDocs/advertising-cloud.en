# Ad Reviews {#ad-reviews}

Once you have created your ad, our Ad Review team will evaluate your ad for the following:

* Video displays correctly
* Audio and video sync correctly
* Click URL matches the video
* Content is appropriate

We do our best to review all ads within 2-4 hours on regular business hours Monday-Friday; however, can take up to 2 days during the weekend.
To check if your ad has been approved. Click on the Ads button under your placement and verify the Review Status. If your status is "incomplete", it means you have not submitted your ad for review or edited your ad and did not resubmit it for review. If your ad was rejected, hold the cursor over the ? to see the reason for rejection.

Inventory partners sometimes have their own approval system. Here are a few common reasons our partners may reject your ad:

* Content is inappropriate for certain audiences on the site
* Restricted products & services such as gambling, fake documents, illegal drugs, weapons, adult sexual services and alcohol
* If your ad contains a black or white background, the video may blend in with the website background
* If your Advertiser URL declared in the campaign section does not match your click url/ ad landing page

If you need to expedite your review, please contact your Account Manager.
You can also set up automated [email alerts & notifications](../../../user-guide/measurement/campaign-reporting/email-alerts-notifications.md) to alert you to potential issues with ad approvals.
