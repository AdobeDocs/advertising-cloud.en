# Ad Unit Setup {#ad-unit-setup}

TubeMogul allows you to set up multiple video ads with one single creative asset. You can use a third-party ad provided by one of our [ad serving partners](../../user-guide/planning/partners/inventory-partners.md) or let TubeMogul serve your ad for free by uploading your own video asset and layering on additional features such as overlays and sharing buttons.

You can configure different ad formats:

* [In-stream Set up](ad-unit-setup/in-stream-setup.md)
* [In-display Set up](ad-unit-setup/in-display-setup.md)
* [Social Set up](ad-unit-setup/social-setup.md)
* [Mobile Set up](ad-unit-setup/mobile-setup.md)
* [Connected TV Set up](ad-unit-setup/connected-tv-setup.md)

Additional ad features include:

* [Overlays](ad-unit-setup/overlay.md)
* [Teasers & Endcaps](/help/user-guide/planning/ad-formats/ad-features-guide/teasers-endcaps.md)
* [Sharing Buttons](ad-unit-setup/sharing-buttons.md)
* [Companion Banner](ad-unit-setup/3rd-party-tracking-adserving/companion-banner.md)

See the [standard specifications for supported ad types](https://www.tubemogul.com/ad-specs/) and [video tutorials for campaign execution](https://education.tubemogul.com/).
