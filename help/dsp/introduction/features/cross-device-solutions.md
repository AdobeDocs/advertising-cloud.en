# Cross-Device Solutions

Advertising Cloud DSP integrations with [!DNL LiveRamp] and [!DNL Adobe Device Co-op] allow you to extend your audience to all of a person's known devices, not just the devices your brand has tracked. The integrations also provide frequency capping and attribution measurement across all devices.

When you use a supported people-based device graph, you can:

* Match audiences across channels and devices to deliver ads to people and households, rather than to devices.
* Balance ad exposure by understanding and capping frequency across individuals.
* Test strategies that expose vs. convert audiences across channels or devices.

## Benefits of Each Device Graph

* [!DNL Adobe Device Co-op]:
    * Provides an opt-in pool of participating Adobe advertisers’ deterministic and probabilistic data
    * Provides strong cookie ID connections powered by desktop and mobile web visitors
    * Includes data predominantly from the United States and Canada
    * Has no usage fees

* [!DNL LiveRamp] device graph:
    * Provides a deterministic data pool, including offline customer data
    * Provides even coverage between cookie IDs and mobile device IDs
    * Includes data predominantly from the United States
    * Is free for frequency capping and attribution measurement
    * Priced at $0.35 CPM for extended impressions (impressions that are delivered solely by using the [!DNL LiveRamp] device graph rather than on devices found within the targeted audience segments)

       The rate is reflected on your account rate card.

## People-Based Frequency Management

People-based frequency management allows you to specify frequency caps at the person level, rather than the device level, for true media exposure control.

### Activate People-Based Frequency Management

* **Campaigns:** When you create a new campaign, you can specify a [!UICONTROL Cross-Device Level] setting. Enable “[!UICONTROL Same Device]” -> “[!UICONTROL People],” and select a device graph. The specified device graph is used for both cross-device targeting at the placement level and for people-based frequency management at the campaign, package, and placement level. Frequency caps apply across all of a person's known devices.

 For more information, see [Campaign Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings.md).

   Once you save a campaign, you can't change its [!UICONTROL Cross Device Level] setting.

* **Packages:**  You can optionally set additional frequency caps at the package level. DSP will respect the strictest frequency cap in the campaign hierarchy.

* **Placements:** You can optionally set additional frequency caps at the placement level. DSP will respect the strictest frequency cap in the campaign hierarchy.

## People-Based Targeting

People-based targeting allows you to find customers across desktop and mobile.

### Activate People-Based Targeting

* **Campaigns:** When you create a new campaign, you can specify a [!UICONTROL Cross-Device Level] setting. Enable “[!UICONTROL Same Device]” -> “[!UICONTROL People],” and select a device graph. The specified device graph is used for both cross-device targeting at the placement level and for people-based frequency management.

 For more information, see [Campaign Settings](/help/dsp/campaign-management/campaigns/campaign-settings.md).

* **Placements:** When you select audience targets for a placement in a campaign with a specified device graph, a [!UICONTROL Cross-Device Targeting] option allows you to extend your targeting across all of a person's known devices (per the device graph specified in the campaign settings), even devices that aren't in the specified segments.

### Set Up Reporting for People-Based Targeting

You can include the following metrics in custom reports:

* **Extended Impressions:** (In the [!UICONTROL Build Your Report] section under [!UICONTROL Metrics] > [!UICONTROL Std. Metrics]) The volume of incremental impressions delivered by leveraging a device graph (and not found within the original audience segments). This metric is also used to calculate applicable fees associated with using a third-party device graph.

   To determine the cost of your extended impressions during a time period, run a custom report that includes the [!UICONTROL Extended Impressions] column, and then multiply the total number of extended impressions by $0.00035 ($0.35/1000 impressions).
   
   The aggregated cost is also included in the [!UICONTROL Billable Other Net Spend] column (under [!UICONTROL Metrics] > [!UICONTROL Spend]), although that metric also includes other campaign fees you may have added.

* **Device Graph:** (In the [!UICONTROL Build Your Report] section under [!UICONTROL Dimensions] > [!UICONTROL Campaign]) The selected device graph for a particular campaign, package, or placement.

## People-Based Attribution Measurement

*Advertisers with Advertising Cloud Conversion Tracking Only*

With people-based attribution, you can attribute conversions that took place on a different device than the device on which the media exposure occurred. People-based attribution measurement is available across DSP, Advertising Cloud Search, and Advertising Cloud Creative for advertisers who have implemented Advertising Cloud conversion pixels on their sites.

### Enable People-Based Attribution Measurement

If you would like to activate cross-device attribution measurement, contact your Adobe account manager. For [!DNL Adobe Device Co-op] accounts, you'll need to provide your signed [!DNL Adobe Device Co-op] contract and Experience Cloud [!DNL Organization ID] (formerly called [!DNL IMS org ID]).

To see if an advertiser account is configured to use a device graph for attribution measurement:

1. In the main menu, click **[!UICONTROL Settings] > [!UICONTROL Advertiser]**.
1. Hold the cursor over the advertiser row and click **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.
1. In the [!UICONTROL Integrations] section of the advertiser settings, see if the [!UICONTROL Cross-Device Attribution] setting is active.

   For active integrations, the device graph is indicated.

### Set Up Conversion Reports for Cross-Device Conversion Attribution

#### Conversion Report Settings

When a device graph is enabled for attribution measurement, the [!UICONTROL Conversion] Report includes a [!UICONTROL Cross-Device Breakout] setting, which allows you to include up to three separate columns for each conversion metric, including:

* <*Conversion*>[!UICONTROL (tp)]: Includes the total conversions (total people), which includes both same-device conversions and cross-device conversions (if applicable). In the report, "[!UICONTROL (tp)]" is appended to the conversion metric name, rule type, and conversion types in the conversion path (for example, "Responses(le)(tl)(tp)).

* <*Conversion*>[!UICONTROL (sd)]: (Optional) Includes only conversions for which only a single device was tracked in the conversion path. In the report, "[!UICONTROL (sd)]" is appended to the conversion metric name, rule type, and conversion types in the conversion path (for example, "Responses(le)(tl)(sd)).

* <*Conversion*>[!UICONTROL (xd)]: (Optional) Includes only conversions for which more than one device was tracked in the conversion path. In the report, "[!UICONTROL (xd)]" is appended to the conversion metric name, rule type, and conversion types in the conversion path (for example, "Responses(le)(tl)(xd)).

#### How to Interpret the Conversion Report

If you sort the percentage of total conversions that are cross-device ([!UICONTROL (xd)]/[!UICONTROL (tl)]) from high to low, you'll understand what is driving above-average cross-device conversions. You can use this to inform your creative or targeting strategy to match messaging and channel investment to user behavior.

* Packages – See which packages drive the most total conversions, and which ones have a high percentage of cross-device conversions. This can help you understand where to focus spend.

* Placements – Compare placement performance and attribution (for example, a mobile web ad may drive conversions on desktop). Without a device graph for attribution, you may miss a mobile web placement’s impact on desktop conversions, or it may be buried if the majority of your users convert on desktop and not mobile web.

* Ads – Discover which ads drive higher conversions, and quantify their value and impact across both web browsers and mobile app environments.

* Sites – Optimize across sites rather than manually excluding sites completely. If a website drives cross-device conversions, then you can see on which devices this behavior occurs.

* Deals – Improve manual optimization by verifying which inventory deals deliver cross-device conversions, and then deciding if you should expand your targeting to include more devices and channels in those deals.
