# Margin Management

Manage and accurately track campaign financial margins directly in DSP by applying a margin to be deducted at either the campaign level or the package level. You can apply either a fixed margin or a dynamic margin.

* **Fixed Margin**: For each campaign, you can enter a gross budget and the pre-negotiated fixed margin percentage, and Advertising Cloud DSP will auto-calculate and cap spend at the net budget at all levels of the campaign.

* **Dynamic Margin**: This option allows you to manage margins down to the placement level and optimize based on the financial efficiency of each placement. This feature gives you more flexibility than fixed margin management but doesn't guarantee the margin %. It is up to the campaign manager to deliver the contracted units at or below the net margin to achieve the required margin.

   Use dynamic margins for insertion orders that consist of several line items for which you've agreed to deliver a fixed amount of units or unit types at a fixed rate. In DSP, the insertion order is represented as a campaign, and line items are represented as packages. Each package has a specific goal, rate, and placements assigned to it. The placements can have different strategies and tactics organized to deliver the line item requirements (which correspond to the "package goals" and "package rates").
