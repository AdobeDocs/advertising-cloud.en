| Date | Feature | Description | For More Information |

|Private Inventory | All users can now set up and edit deal ID details using a new deal ID form, which is a simplified version of the legacy [!UICONTROL Smart Ad Serving] form. To set up new deal ID details, go to [!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals], click [!UICONTROL Create], and then click [!UICONTROL Deal ID Beta]. | See [Manually Create Deal ID Details](/help/dsp/inventory/deal-id-create.md) and [Manual Deal ID Settings](/help/dsp/inventory/deal-id-settings.md) |
| Placement Forecasting | For placements with placement-level pacing, the [!UICONTROL Forecast] section of the placement settings includes a new [!UICONTROL Estimated Maximums] section, which indicates how much more capacity is available with the current targeting configuration. | &mdash; |
| 21 September 2020 | Product Help | This new help set will be expanded in the coming weeks and will eventually replace the existing help available from the "[!UICONTROL Help]" link in the main menu. | &mdash; |
