# What's New

The following features are new or recently changed.

| Date | Feature | Description | For More Information |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| 12 April 2022 | Campaign Management | Ad specifications were updated to reflect current support. | See "[Specifications for Supported Ad Types](/help/dsp/campaign-management/ads/ad-specs.md)." |
| 17 February 2022 | Video tutorials | A new video on "How to Create a Standard Display Placement" is available. | See [Advertising Cloud Tutorials](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/advertising-cloud-learn/tutorials/dsp/placement-create.html). |
| 31 January 2022 | Help | Additional information about [!DNL Deal IDs] and [!DNL Simple Ad Serving] is now available. | See the subchapter on Inventory > Private Inventory. |
| 10 December 2021 | Video tutorials | New video tutorials are available: "Introduction to Advertising Cloud DSP," "Account Structure and User Interface," "How to Create a Package," "How to Bulk Upload Third-Party Ad Tags," and "How to Edit Placements Using Bulk Edit Tools." | See "[Advertising Cloud Tutorials](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/advertising-cloud-learn/tutorials/overview.html)." |
| 12 November 2021 | [!UICONTROL Deal IDs] | In the [!UICONTROL Deal ID] settings, "[!DNL Rubicon]" was changed to "[!DNL Magnite DV+]," where [!DNL DV+] stands for display, video, and other formats such as audio. This reflects the new branding for [!DNL Magnite] SSP. **Note:** [!DNL Magnite DV+] is still listed as "[!DNL Rubicon]" in the [!UICONTROL Deal ID Inbox]. | See "[SSP Partners](/help/dsp/inventory/ssp-partners.md)." |
| 27 October 2021 | Custom Reports | You can now create and manage [!DNL Amazon S3] and different types of FTP delivery locations, called *[!DNL report destinations]*, for your custom reports. Once you configure report destinations, you can set up each of your new custom reports to be delivered to one or more locations of a single destination type, or to email recipients. Updates to your [!DNL Amazon S3] and FTP credentials won't interrupt report delivery.<br><br>Your existing reports are still sent to the specified email recipients. To configure delivery to a different report destination, create a new report with the new destination. | See "[About [!UICONTROL Report Destinations]](/help/dsp/reports/report-destinations/report-destination-about.md)," "[Create a [!UICONTROL Report Destination]](/help/dsp/reports/report-destinations/report-destination-create.md)," "[[!UICONTROL Report Destination] Settings](/help/dsp/reports/report-destinations/report-destination-settings.md)," and "[Custom Report Settings](/help/dsp/reports/report-settings.md)." |
|  | [!UICONTROL Packages], [!UICONTROL Placements], and [!UICONTROL Ads] views| When you view data for a single day, the trend charts now include hourly data. Hold the cursor over any point to see the data for that hour. | See "[Single Campaign Reporting](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-reports-about.md#single-campaign-reporting)." |
|  | [!UICONTROL Placements] | The placement [!UICONTROL Inspector] now includes an [!UICONTROL Inventory] tab, which shows all deals and their associated metrics for the placement. Use the information to make quick adjustments or troubleshoot issues without generating a custom report. | See "[Placement [!UICONTROL Inspector]](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-reports-about.md#placement-inspector)." |
|  | [!UICONTROL Ads] | (Users with permission to include [!DNL Clearcast] clock numbers in their ads) DSP no longer shows an error if you use a clock number that's attached to another ad. **Note:**  The best practice is to use a unique clock number for each video ad. Otherwise, the publisher won't approve all of the ads. | &mdash; |
|  | [!UICONTROL Deal IDs] | The [!UICONTROL Deal ID] settings and other places in the user interface reflect new branding for [!DNL Magnite] SSP:<br><ul><li>The SSP "[!DNL Tremor]" ([!DNL Telaria]) is now "[!DNL Magnite CTV]."</li><li>In the coming weeks, [!DNL Rubicon]" will change to "[!DNL Magnite DV+]," where [!DNL DV+] stands for display, video, and other formats such as audio.</li></ul> | See "[SSP Partners](/help/dsp/inventory/ssp-partners.md)." |
|  | [!DNL Freewheel] programmatic guaranteed deals | You can now submit ads and check the status of ads for [!DNL Freewheel] programmatic guaranteed deals from the [!UICONTROL Ads] view. Previously, you could do both only from the [!UICONTROL Deals] view.  | See "[Submit an Ad for a Programmatic Guaranteed Deal to [!DNL Freewheel]](/help/dsp/inventory/freewheel-submit.md)" and "[Check the Status of Ads for [!DNL Freewheel] Programmatic Guaranteed Deals](/help/dsp/inventory/freewheel-check-status.md)." |
| 7 October 2021 | Help | All [DSP and other Advertising Cloud documentation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/advertising-cloud.html) on [!DNL Experience League] is now machine translated into all available languages. To change the displayed language, use the “Change Language” menu at the bottom left of any page.<br>![Change language](/help/dsp/assets/change-language.png) |
| 30 September 2021 | Brand Safety | (22 September release) [!DNL DoubleVerify] brand safety pre-bid products were updated to [!DNL Brand Suitability Tiers], which allow advertisers to choose between three risk levels (low, medium, and high) for specific segments without avoiding all instances of a certain topic. Historically, segments did not include any tolerance levels.<br><br>To align with the new [!DNL DoubleVerify] segment structure, DSP migrated your existing brand safety segments to their new, recommended *medium*-level segment. You can optionally adjust the segment tier to *low* or *high*.<br><br>**Note:** A small list of segments don't have tiers but have new names, such as “Nuisance/Spyware/Malware,Warez” > Incentivized/Malware/Clutter.” | &mdash; |
| | Optimization | The following optimization goals and pre-bid filters were deprecated:<ul><li>Optimization goals:<ul><li>[!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Viewability Rate (Moat – GroupM)]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Always Max Bid & Highest Viewability Rate (Moat – MRC)]</li></ul><li>Pre-bid filters goals:<ul><li>[!UICONTROL Viewability IAS]</li><li>[!UICONTROL Viewability Moat]</li></ul></ul> | See "[Optimization Goals and How to Use Them](/help/dsp/optimization/optimization-goals.md)" and "[Placement-level Pre-Bid Filters and How to Use Them](/help/dsp/optimization/optimization-pre-bid-filters.md)." |

You can also filter the [!UICONTROL Placements] and [!UICONTROL Ads] views by [!UICONTROL Creation date]. | See "[Create a Custom Column View](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/column-view-create.md)" and "[Filter Campaign Data](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-data-filter.md)." |
| | Programmatic guaranteed deals | (8 September release) You can now edit the [!UICONTROL Max Bid] for the default placement for a programmatic guaranteed (PG) deal. However, because PG deals always have a fixed CPM, only international clients should edit the [!UICONTROL Max Bid] to take into account currency exchange fees. | &mdash; |
|  |  | (8 September release) Users with the “[!DNL FreeWheel Programmatic Guaranteed]” permission can now submit an ad to the [!DNL FreeWheel Programmatic Creative API] from the [!UICONTROL Ads] view or the [!UICONTROL Placements] view.
