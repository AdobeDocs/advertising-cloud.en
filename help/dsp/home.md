|15 October 2020 | Private Inventory | All users can now set up and edit deal ID details using a new deal ID form, which is a simplified version of the legacy [!UICONTROL Smart Ad Serving] form. To set up new deal ID details, go to [!UICONTROL Inventory] > [!UICONTROL Deals], click [!UICONTROL Create], and then click [!UICONTROL Deal ID Beta]. | See "[Manually Create Deal ID Details](/help/dsp/inventory/deal-id-create.md)" and "[Manual Deal ID Settings](/help/dsp/inventory/deal-id-settings.md)." |
| | Placement Forecasting | For placements with placement-level pacing, the [!UICONTROL Forecast] section of the placement settings includes a new [!UICONTROL Estimated Maximums] section, which indicates how much more capacity is available with the current targeting configuration. | &mdash; |
| 2 September 2020 | Reports | Any organization with multiple DSP accounts can optionally enable cross-account data in custom reports, according to the organization's needs. | See the "Cross-Account Reporting" section in "[About Custom Reports](/help/dsp/reports/report-about.md#cross-account-reporting)." |
