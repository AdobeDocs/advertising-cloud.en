# Available Report Metrics

<!-- Shay has been maintaining a list at https://education.tubemogul.com/new/glossary-of-reporting-metrics-and-dimensions/. We need to migrate it to Markdown. A table is ideal, but text organized into sections would be easier for now. See /help/dsp/campaign-management/placements/placement-settings.md for an example of how to organize settings. -->
