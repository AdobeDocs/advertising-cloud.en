# About Custom Reports {#reports-about-custom}

Custom reports (formerly called email reports) allow you to customize the content and delivery of your report data using the campaign dimensions (such as the advertiser, placement, sites, or geos) and the metrics that matter most to you. You can either:

* Completely configure campaign performance reports at a granular level.
* Choose from pre-configured report templates, and optionally customize them further.

You can generate reports once, or schedule them to be generated daily, weekly, or monthly at 03:00 in the specified time zone. Once a report is generated, a notification is sent to each specified email recipient, with a link from which to download the file.

>You can also view on-demand data at all levels of a campaign (campaign, package, placement, ad, or survey) [within the relevant campaign management view](/help/dsp/campaign-management/reports/campaign-reports-about.md).
