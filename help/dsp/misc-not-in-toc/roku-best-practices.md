# Roku Setup Best Practices {#roku-setup-best-practrices}

Accessing Roku inventory has never been easier than through the Adobe Advertising platform. Once you've completed the planning process, you can login and tap into premium Roku publishers by launching the placement creation process.

* Navigate to the [!UICONTROL New Placement] dropdown, select [!UICONTROL Television] > [!UICONTROL Roku] under the [!UICONTROL Connected TV] section.

* In this view, you'll be able to enter your placement name, goals and pacing strategy. When choosing the name, consider including *Roku* in the title as quick identifier on the placement list screen.

* Once you've completed that section, you can set the location to the United States or a location (state or zip code) within the U.S
* Next is inventory. In this section you can choose from your private Roku deals and/or our On Demand Library that has Roku Audience Network and The Roku Channel

* To choose the appropriate inventory, you must check the boxes next to each inventory title, as well as the pencil icon to choose specific deals within each category. In the image above, the top-level boxes are checked, but you'll have to drill into each section to actually select an inventory type.
* Under the [!UICONTROL Roku Private] section you can search for specific deals by keyword or deal ID.See [Deal IDs](deal-ids.md).
* Under the [!UICONTROL Roku On Demand] section, you can click on the pencil and then find the On Demand deal you've already been granted access to or choose the [!UICONTROL Visit On Demand] button to begin the subscription process.
* In the library, search for *Roku* in the keyword filter to find all the relevant deals and hover over the box to request access or check out the relevant deals.

* From there, you can navigate back to the placement page and layer on Audience Targeting

  ![Screen Shot 2019-08-01 at 2.20.03 PM](assets/screen-shot-2019-08-01-at-2.20.03-pm.png)

* Click into [!UICONTROL Audience Segments] and you can choose datasets from the leading 3rd party DMPs, 1st party segments from Adobe Marketing Cloud, 1st party segments from other DMPs and Custom segments `ex.retargeting` that have been matched against Roku's (opt'd-in) deterministic dataset.
* From there you can also create audience rules that allow you to group segments and suppress segments based on your strategy.

* Lastly, you can attach 3rd party tracking pixels from ad serving or approved measurement partners. The full list of measurement partners is as follows:

  * Nielsen Catalina Solution
  * Experian
  * Research Now
  * Oracle
  * Kantar
  * Polk
  * Acxiom
  * Placed
  * comScore
  * Factual

* Next step is to click [!UICONTROL Create Placement] and you're all set!
