# Writing Survey Questions {#writing-survey-questions}

**Best Practices**
  
When writing a survey question, follow these guidelines:

1. Define Your Goals.Whether or not your survey is related to an ongoing campaign, make sure you have defined KPIs for your research. This will not only help you write the best questions, but also to interpret the results down the road.
1. Consider the Creative. Look at the creative and the brand message – Whether or not you’re running a study directly connected to a video campaign, understanding the brand’s media presence will give you context for writing your question.  Ideally, if you’re running a control/exposed study to assess ad effectiveness, you want to keep the questions as closely aligned as possible with the content of your creative.
1. Avoid Complexity. Draft as concise a question as you can – then read it out loud.   A question might look great on paper, but sound off when you say it out loud.
1. Test Your Question. Ask a colleague to read your question and explain what s/he thinks it’s asking.  If they don’t interpret it as you intended, try a rewrite.

**Common Pitfalls**
  
Even the best researchers hit roadblocks when it comes to writing survey questions, especially ones that fit into a 300x250 ad unit!   Here are some common pitfalls and how to fix them.

* Long answer choices or questions; remember that the whole survey has to fit in a 300x250 space.   If you’re unsure about your question length, create a survey with your draft question and preview it in the platform to see how it looks (instructions below).   Often overly long questions or answer choices should really be two questions.
* Biased wording that starts with a positive (or negative) angle without a counter, for example, “to what extent do you agree”, “how favorable is your opinion” rather than more neutral approaches like, “Do you agree or disagree” or “What is your opinion”.
* Purchase intent questions with big ticket and high end items can be tricky.  Most of the people responding to your survey might say they want a luxury car in a brand favorability question.  However, if you ask the same people if they’re planning to buy a luxury car the next time they are in the market for a new vehicle, the results will probably be very different. Also be careful about asking about intent to purchase big ticket items in a short timeframe unless you are specifically targeting in-market shoppers.
* Open ended or overly complex questions that resemble a focus group or interview query.  BrandSights is best used with short questions with clear answer choices.
* Awareness questions that ask around a well-known brand(s).   For example, imagine advertising the re-release of a Beatles album.  If you run an ad effectiveness study with a question like, “which of the following bands have you heard of” and the answer choices include the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, U2 and Led Zeppelin, you probably won’t see a lift.
* Answer choices that aren’t mutually exclusive or collectively exhaustive – in other words, two responses sort of mean the same thing or if there were other, obvious, positions that the respondent could take.
