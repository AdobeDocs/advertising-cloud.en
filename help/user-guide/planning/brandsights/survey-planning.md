# Survey Planning {#survey-planning}

**Creating Questions**
It is easy to write a survey question, but writing a good one can be difficult. A good question gets to the information you or your client needs in a way that is clear, concise, and connected to the advertising message.&nbsp;Follow these&nbsp; [best practices](survey-planning/writing-survey-questions.md)&nbsp;to write a strong survey question.   
**Question Counts**
  
BrandSights allows you a maximum of 5 questions; however, serving more than 2 or 3 questions generally decreases the response rate.   
**Sample Size&nbsp;**
  
In order for results to reveal statistically significant differences between your&nbsp;respondent&nbsp;groups, it is recommended to have at least 200 responses per question per group. For example, if you have a single question survey with an exposed and control group, then you should gather 400 responses total - 200 for each group.
**Response Rate**

* 0.05%-0.1%

**Cost of Media&nbsp;**

* $1-$3 CPM
