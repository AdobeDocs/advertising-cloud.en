# Feed Management {#feed-management}

To manage your feeds, go back to Private Inventory in the top navigation. This Private Inventory feed management page groups your feeds by&nbsp;Publisher Name, metrics on how the feeds are delivering and performing and also warns you of feeds potentially serving blank impressions or not getting any activity. A few metrics defined below although you can go in filter by an other&nbsp;20+ metrics that we offer at the site level.

* **Auctions**: The number of auctions we have observed for the feed – this represents the number of opportunities we saw to buy inventory on this feed, and it’s shown as an integer.
* **Bid rate**: The percentage of auctions where a bid was submitted for this particular feed – this is shown as a percentage, and is calculated as bids divided by auctions.
* **Win rate**: &nbsp;A win is an impression that you bid on successfully. The win rate is the&nbsp;percentage of auctions where the impression was won in this feed &nbsp;- this is shown as a percentage, and is calculated as impressions/bids.
* **`Red` **means the feed requires immediate attention most likely because there is no activity on the feed or a default ad is missing from a guaranteed feed.
* `**Orange**` means the feed will need attention soon most likely because an ad flight is ending within 4 days.
* Progress bar: Will only show up if you filled out the optional 'Tracking" section of the [BrandAccess Feed Creation](../../../../user-guide/planning/private-inventory/brandaccess.md) modal. The purple bar indicates actual budget spent vs. desired spend. Blue bars indicate impressions delivered vs goal.

**Blue gear icon options in the right:&nbsp;**

* **Edit&nbsp;**your feed

    * Some edits will change the tag structure and **require you to resend it to the publisher**. These include changes to:

        * Duration
        * Ad Server
        * Guaranteed&nbsp;or Non-Guaranteed

            * If you are making a non-guaranteed feed into a guaranteed feed, you will need to choose a default ad and the system will create a placement for you.
            * If you are making a guaranteed feed into a non-guaranteed feed, you should pause the guaranteed placement and default ad.
            * **If you are making a "guaranteed" or "non-guaranteed" change, we recommend creating a new tag and archiving outdated tags.&nbsp;**

    * If you need to change the billing method - from direct from the publisher to through TubeMogul (or vice versa), please contact your Account Manager&nbsp;to assist with the transition.

* **Attach an ad** &nbsp;(This option will only show up if your feed is guaranteed)
* **Email Tag&nbsp;**
* **Archive:&nbsp;**When you are a frequent user of this feature, you may want to move old feeds out of the regular view, to see only your most current inventory sources.&nbsp;&nbsp; When you archive a feed, it will move to the archive section and be viewable by clicking on the “Archived Feeds” section at the bottom of the page. Archiving a feed will not stop traffic from running on the feed.
* **Placements and Ads** is another way to troubleshoot and double-check that your private inventory feeds are set up properly&nbsp;and receiving inventory. This page uses the same Orange and Red indicators as the main Private Inventory feed management page and shows you which ads and placements are targeting a feed and which ones need attention.
