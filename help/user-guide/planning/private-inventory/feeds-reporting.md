# Feed Reporting {#feed-reporting}

On the main feed management page at DSP > Private Inventory > Analytics, you can access more than 30 metrics, ranging from impressions and costs, to completion rates and click throughs to conversions, broken out by publisher and feed.

The metrics you see onscreen and in the exports are for the specified date range. To change the metrics displayed onscreen, click the metric list icon next to the Options column on the top right. To see all metrics at once, you can export all of the data to Excel for both the active and archived feeds sections by clicking “Export” button or the Excel icon.

## Feed Details

At the individual feed level, click the gear icon and then select “See Report” to see detailed data. The data includes all of the same metrics as you did on the main page by clicking on the data icon, but you can also view and export reporting by Advertiser, Campaign, Ad Type and Site. You can also get private feed reporting via customized [Email Reports](../../../user-guide/measurement/campaign-reporting/email-reports.md).
