# Planning in GRP Mode {#planning-in-grp-mode}

Use your GRP planning tool to project Cost Per Point (CPP), On-Target CPM, and On-Target Percentage based on your GRP goal and budget for a particular campaign plan:

1. Click New Placement
1. Select type of Ad Unit
1. Make sure you are in BrandPoint View/ GRP Mode
1. Set your Goals: Audience Target, GRP Goal, Frequency Cap
1. Budget: Set your flight dates and Budget and Inventory Tier (1-3 or all recommended given this is an audience buy)
1. Set your target location
1. Take a look at the Fill Estimator chart on the right to see estimated costs and on target percentage.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can still filter by specific public inventory, private inventory, or other filters, such as day parting, device targeting, and audience targeting.
>If you started off with a GRP goal, to figure out the budget needed to fill this goal, slide the Budget bar until it intersects with the GRP goal
