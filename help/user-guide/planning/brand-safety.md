# Brand Safety {#brand-safety}

We've integrated multiple layers of brand protection to ensure that your video ads never run beside content unworthy of your brand. Each component of BrandSafe acts as a barrier between your video ad and unsavory websites:

* [SiteSafe](brand-safety/sitesafe-quality.md)
* [PageSafe](brand-safety/pagesafe-proximic.md)
* [PlaySafe](brand-safety/playsafe-fake-pre-roll.md)
* [Blacklists](brand-safety/blacklists/) can also be applied at the account or advertiser level.
