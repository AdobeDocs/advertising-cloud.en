# BrandSights {#brandsights}

Gather insights by audience, geography and site to drive brand impact in real-time. Pay only for the cost of media to run the surveys.
BrandSights allows Platform users to create custom branded surveys and deploy them with any video campaign. For the first time, brand marketers can measure brand awareness, favorability and purchase intent using a targetable survey tool integrated into a media buying platform.&nbsp;BrandSights surveys generate actionable insights that give brand marketers a better understanding of their consumers, ultimately enabling smarter media decisions.   
**Simple to Create and Launch**
  
Easily create, target and launch your own surveys within the Platform. [Customize questions](brandsights/survey-planning/writing-survey-questions.md) to align with your branding objectives, apply desired targeting parameters, and launch. It's that simple.
  
**Target Surveys in the Same Way as Media**
  
Apply the same granular targeting the Platform&nbsp;offers your video ads to your surveys. Surveys will only run against the exact sites, geographies and demographics you select - ensuring you receive the insights that matter most to your campaign.   
**Measure and Optimize to Brand Lift**
  
Run different [types of surveys](brandsights/types-surveys.md) to track lift in brand awareness, favorability and purchase intent generated by your video ads. BrandSights uses a [control/exposed methodology](brandsights/survey-planning/controlexposed-methodology.md)to compare viewers and non-viewers of your ads. Insights are available in real-time down to the audience, geography, and site level, enabling mid-campaign optimization to drive brand lift higher.
