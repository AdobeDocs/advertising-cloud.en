# PageSafe (Proximic) {#pagesafe-proximic}

PageSafe examines the content of individual webpages and determines if they contain objectionable content. Integrated into our real-time buying process, it blocks ads before they are ever served on pages with unsavory content. PageSafe is powered by data from our technology partner Proximic.

Pages are categorized into safety tiers (G, PG-13, R, etc) and objectionable topics (alcohol, accidents, violence, etc). Advertisers have full control over what types of pages their ads run on. This feature is available at an additional CPM fee.
