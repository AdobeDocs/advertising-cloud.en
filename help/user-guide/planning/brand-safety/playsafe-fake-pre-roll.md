# PlaySafe (Fake Pre-roll) {#playsafe-fake-pre-roll}

PlaySafe prevents pre-roll video ads from auto-playing within display banners on low quality sites. This is a widespread practice that defrauds advertisers who think they are buying regular pre-roll advertising, but are instead getting an ad unit with much less value.

[ ![fake-pr](assets/fake-pr-300x194.png)](assets/fake-pr.png)

 

Our technology detects ad unit and video player sizes and other attributes to determine whether the unit is regular or autoplay pre-roll. The default is set to exclude this type of inventory unless otherwise specified by your team during the site list planning process.
