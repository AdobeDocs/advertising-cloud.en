# Media Quality Assessment {#media-quality-assessment}

TubeMogul’s Video Viewability Audit allows marketers to maximize brand visibility and ensure high-quality ad placements. The free audit is available on any pre-roll campaign – even on inventory not purchased through TubeMogul – and is not specific to any one exchange, network or marketplace.
  
Our [site-level audit reporting](../../../user-guide/measurement/viewability.md) provides in-depth stats on 11 different viewability metrics – so you can see exactly which variables impact viewability rates – and lets you verify site delivery across all your pre-roll video ad buys to help better inform your media buying decisions.

Our viewability audit is free for any pre-roll campaign. The audit works on most publishers that run VPIAD enabled media and requires no integrations or changes to a publisher's website.
