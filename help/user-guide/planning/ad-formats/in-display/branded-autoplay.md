# Branded Autoplay {#branded-autoplay}

![BAP](assets/bap.png)

**Player Action:**

* Video plays above the fold, with the sound off, when the page loads
* If a viewer unmutes the video at any point, it begins playing from the beginning with the sound on

**Benefits:**

* Motion of playing video draws viewers interest
* Ideal for video that conveys messaging with sound off
* Add branded overlays and sharing buttons to drive user actions and ensure brand association
* Video can be any length (< 2 min recommended)
* Low CPMs can help increase margins

**Considerations:**

* Good creative is essential

**Recommended Pricing Model:**

* [CPM](../../../../user-guide/planning/ad-formats/performance-pricing.md)

**Video Specifications:**

* View asset specs [here](../../../../user-guide/planning/ad-formats/ad-specs.md)
