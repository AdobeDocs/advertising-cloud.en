# Display {#display}

`As brand advertisers increasingly leverage more cross-channel strategies, effectively managing these campaigns through a single platform is paramount. TubeMogul’s display solution allows you to engage users through banners as well as video**. **`With in-display ads, your ad&nbsp;is the content – giving the viewer an engaged, non-interruptive experience that they choose to watch. These ads&nbsp;are also perfect for videos that are longer than 0:30 seconds. Add branded overlays, social sharing buttons and calls-to-action to any video.
  
Choose from our [Standard Display](in-display/standard-display.md) Offering&nbsp;(300x250, 728x90, 160x600, 300x600) or utilize our Display video Options:&nbsp; [Click-to-Play](in-display/click-to-play.md),&nbsp; [Rollover-to-Play](in-display/rollover-to-play.md),&nbsp; [Branded Autoplay](in-display/branded-autoplay.md)and&nbsp; [Click to Expand](in-display/click-to-expand.md).
