# Segment Management {#segment-management}

Once you've [created retargeting pixels](retargeting-pixel-setup.md), manage your segments in the Tools> Segments section as well.  This section allows you to quickly view the segments associated with a specific advertiser, confirm their status and monitor user counts.  You can:

* Group segments by advertiser
* Filter by advertiser
* Check status to view active segments
