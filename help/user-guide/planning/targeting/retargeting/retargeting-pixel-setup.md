# Retargeting Pixel Setup {#retargeting-pixel-setup}

To create a retargeting pixel:

1. Click on Tools in the top navigation bar and select "SEGMENTS".

   ![Segments](assets/segments.png)

1. Click on New Custom Segment and Name the segment. It should be something that clearly states what type of cookie pool you are collecting. For example: Homepage Visitors- Site X.
  
1. Click on the gear icon on the right side and select "get pixel". Use the HTML tag if you are placing it on a website and use the Flash tag if you are attaching it to an ad.

1. Use a Debugging tool such as Charles or Fiddler to doublecheck that the TubeMogul pixel is firing correctly.
  
1. Check the Segments section periodically to confirm Segment Size is increasing. You can also use this tool to manage the segments in your account.
