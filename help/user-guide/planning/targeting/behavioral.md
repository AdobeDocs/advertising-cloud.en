**Custom Segments**
This tool also allows you to access to access first party data targeting in two ways:

* Collecting cookies within the platform by [creating a retargeting pixel](retargeting/retargeting-pixel-setup.md) and [retargeting](retargeting.md) users

* Another option is to load your own DMP's data into our platform - this requires working with your Account Manager

**Best Practice**

* Not recommended for tight targeted campaigns (ex: dma, zipcode, dayparted, etc)
* Ideal segment list should include at least 10M user counts
* Using this Thirdparty Segments will incur an additional data cost. Check the Audience tool for pricing.
