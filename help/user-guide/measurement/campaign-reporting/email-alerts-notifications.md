# Email Alerts & Notifications {#email-alerts-notifications}

Set up automatic email alerts about account and campaign progress and status, and minimize the need to log into the platform. 

If you are not actively checking campaign reporting within the platform, the best practice is to set up email reports as soon as possible after a campaign has launched.

Available alerts include:

* Account

    * Account Balance
    * Account Spend

* Campaigns

    * No Campaign Spend
    * Campaign Spend
    * No Campaign Impressions
    * Campaign eCPM

* Ads

    * Ad Rejections

* Feeds

    * Feed Win Rate
    * Feed Bid Rate
    * No Feed Spend
    * No Feed Impressions

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature doesn't send alerts about performance-level data, not about recent placement changes to max bids, budgets, or status.

## Activate this feature

* Navigate to "My Account"
