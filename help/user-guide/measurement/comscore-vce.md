# ComScore Reporting {#comscore-reporting}

TubeMogul has partnered with ComScore to offer audience verification reporting also known as Validated Campaign Essentials (vCE). This reporting is available within the platform via Brandpoint at the placement level or at the campaign level.
Campaign level reporting will enable reporting on every desktop placement in the campaign. If you are interested in getting audience verification across desktop and mobile placements, see [Nielsen OCR Reporting](nielsen-ocr-reporting.md).

 
`Activation - Campaign Level:`

* Navigate to the Campaign page and click 'New Camapign'
* At the bottom of the Campaign Creation page is the '3rd Party Verification' section - select Comscore
* Once you've selected Comscore, additional options will pop up and you can select the age/gender you'd like to measure against

    * For US - you can also select 'Hispanic' to measure against that population
    * For Canada- 'French Speaking' is the additional metric
