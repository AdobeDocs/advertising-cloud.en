[ ![brand sights reporting 1](assets/brand-sights-reporting-1.jpg)](assets/brand-sights-reporting-1.jpg) [ ![brand sights reporting 2](assets/brand-sights-reporting-2.jpg)](assets/brand-sights-reporting-2.jpg)
The stats are based on response to all questions in the survey:

* % Favorable: The % of respondents who answered favorably to questions throughout the survey.
* % Lift: The percentage of favorable exposed responses less than percentage of favorable control responses.
* Respondents: The number of respondents who answered at least one survey question in the control and exposed groups.
* Response Rate: The number of responses divided by survey impressions served in the control and exposed groups.
* n= &nbsp;is the respondents per group
* Trend: Shows the percentage of respondents who answered favorably over time.
* Rollup: Shows the percentage of respondents by answer.
* Error Bars: Indicate if results are statistically significant. If the error bars do not overlap between control and exposed, then the results are statistically significant. The minimum responses per question should be at least 200.

**Best Practices:&nbsp;**

* Have at least 200 respondents per group
* For statistical significance, make sure error bars do not overlap with each other.
* Remember the formula BrandLift=&nbsp;% Exposed Favorable-&nbsp;% Control Favorable
* Recommended to have no more than 2 questions within one survey ad given drop off rates tend to get very large
* Campaign should run for at least 1 month if you are conducting a control/exposed study. You want to make sure your cookie pool for exposed viewers is at least 500k cookies
