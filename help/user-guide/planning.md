If you are a new user, we recommend going through the User Guide by following the campaign life cycle stages: Planning, Execution, Optimization and Measurement.

## Campaign Planning Thought Process

1. Analyze campaign goals and objectives
1. Select appropriate Ad Units
1. Choose targeting strategies
1. Use our planning tools to verify inventory availability
1. Consider additional features available such as BrandSights, brand safety, interactive units, Private Inventory

## Analyze Campaign Goals and Objectives

* Brand: Who is the advertiser?
* Campaign Goal: What are they trying to achieve with this campaign? Is it awareness, message association, etc.
* Flight Dates: How long is the campaign running?
* Budget: Does it make sense to diversify the media buy with multiple units and tactics?
* Frequency Cap: How many times a unique viewer can see the ad for a given time frame.
* Assets: Re-purposed TV asset or made for web asset? 15s, 30s or longer?
* Ad Units: Selection will depend on the assets available and campaign goal.
* Geo-target: What locations do they want the ad to be served?
* Target Audience: Who are they trying to reach?
