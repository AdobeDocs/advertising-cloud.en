# Measurement {#measurement}

TubeMogul is an industry leader in real-time insights and analytics. We offer various types of reporting:

* [UI On-Demand Reporting:](measurement/campaign-reporting.md) Easily access on-demand campaign data at any point throughout campaign flight to gain actionable insights in real time - down to the site level . TubeMogulâ€™s comprehensive set of on-demand data reports include: campaign overview with 50+ metrics, on-target audience demographics as verified via Nielsen OCR and ComScore vCE, geographic snapshots of where your ads ran and more. This type of reporting is best leveraged when you want your report immediately, on a one-time ad hoc basis for optimization or reporting purposes.

    * [Viewability Reporting](measurement/viewability.md): See site level viewability reporting and find out where people are actually viewing your ad.
    * [Viewability Audit](planning/brand-safety/viewability-audit.md): Get a free viewability audit for your campaigns run outside of TubeMogul.
    * [Audience Verification & Nielsen Reporting](measurement/nielsen-ocr-reporting.md): Verify if you've reached your target audience via Nielsen OCR and ComScore vCE reporting.
    * Real time Stats :  monitor real time bids and win rates to make optimization decisions.
    * [Innovid Reporting](measurement/innovid-reporting.md): track basic interactive pre-roll engagement activity within the TubeMogul UI or if running an Innovid ad, log into the Innovid dashboard for more granular engagement data.

* Custom [Email Reports](measurement/campaign-reporting/email-reports.md) (Also known as Email Reports, Custom Reports, DataCube): customizable scheduled reports delivered straight to your inbox on a regular basis. This gives you the flexibility and control to build reports based on the specific campaign dimensions (e.g advertiser, placement, sites, geos, etc) and metrics that matter most to your objectives. This type of option is most effective when you want to look at very specific campaign data and have to send reports to various campaign stakeholders on a one-off, daily, weekly or monthly basis.
