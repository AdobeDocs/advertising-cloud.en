# Notifications {#notifications}

Notifications provide visibility into placement problems and offer potential solutions. Use notifications to troubleshoot placement-wide issues.

This tool has three main features:

![notifications](assets/notifications.png)

* Alerts and suggested actions. Alerts are categorized red flags or warnings over potential issues that may be blocking/preventing a placement from performing as expected. Note: these are not emailed alerts.

  * RED LEVEL (high)

    * Not enough money in account to support all active placement budgets
    * No ads attached to this placement
    * No active ads for this placement
    * Ad has been admin rejected
    * Placement has a low win rate

  * ORANGE LEVEL (Medium)

    * This placement is active but has surpassed it’s end date
    * Approaching campaign budget cap. You have spent X% of your budget cap
    * Placement is inactive
    * Ad has not been admin approved yet
    * Currently, there are no active ads for placement’s custom flight
    * This placement is ending soon

* Recent changes is as an activity log for account user changes made to the following:

    * Max bid
    * Budget
    * Start Date
    * End date
    * Goals
    * Status
    * Frequency Cap
    * Placement Name

* Exchange approval/rejection will list ad approval/rejection reports from an exchange. (for e.g. if Google AdX rejects an ad)

## Where to find it:

There are two places in the UI where the Notifications will be accessible:

* From placement reports in a tab called Notifications

   ![Notifications 2](assets/notifications-2.png)

* From edit placement page, in a section called Notifications

   ![Notifications 3](assets/notifications-3.png)

## What it currently does not do:

* While you can access the feature from any placement report page, it's not available in the edit placement page for BrandPoint placements.
* The first iteration doesn't track changes for targeting parameters like site lists, geos, and audience segments.
* It doesn't track changes by user.
