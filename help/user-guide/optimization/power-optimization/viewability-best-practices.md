# Viewability Best Practices {#viewability-best-practices}

Here are a few suggestions on how to optimize when running viewability campaigns:

1. Set daily pacing goal to "Fill As Fast As Possible" this will ensure that you maximize your opportunity to reach the most viewable audience at any point in the day.

1. Use our  [Optimization Goals](../../../user-guide/optimization/optimization-goals.md) feature and set the Viewability metric above "Ensure Delivery". This feature optimizes against site and source to deliver the highest viewability possible. Set only one performance metric when using this tool to ensure that it is working at optimum levels. When balancing several secondary KPIs it can affect your scale/delivery for the placement.

1. Broaden your targeting parameters. If you're interested in using behavioral targeting, make sure to blend it with contextual targeting to maximize reach.

1. For the best results, use a variety of sites (Tiers 1-3), use Optimization Goals, and then consolidate to a more distinct white list based on the data that comes through on your campaign.

1. Include TubeMogul Select (TMS) inventory to the campaign. TMS is premium inventory that can be found in the Site List editor within our platform. When using this inventory, we suggest bidding between $25-$30 to access enough scale to drive your campaign.

1. Throughout the campaign, be sure to make manual optimizations on the site level as well as using the Optimization Goals feature. Both methods will maximize your viewability results.

1. Lastly, the CPM (Max Media Bid) can greatly affect viewability performance. If your rate is $8-$10, it may be difficult to reach enough scale across premium publishers to get the optimal viewability rate.
