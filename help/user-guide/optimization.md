# Optimization {#optimization}

**Optimize on Metrics You Care About**

Advertising Cloud DSP automatically adjusts spend to sites that deliver the metrics you care about most, ensuring your dollars are spent efficiently to achieve your goals.

<!-- For each of your placements and packages, you can choose an [optimization goal](optimization/optimization-goals.md). The available optimization goals includes preset options, such as "Lowest Cost per Click," and custom goals you've set up as objectives in Advertising Cloud Search. -->

<!-- Clarify if need a page on power optimization and edit/delete this list accordingly. -->
Within our platform we offer two types of optimization:

* [Optimization Goals (Auto Optimization)](optimization/optimization-goals.md)
* [Power Optimization ( Manual- Complete Control)](optimization/power-optimization.md)

<!-- Combine all troubleshooting sources? -->
For information about troubleshooting performance, see [Troubleshooting](optimization/troubleshooting.md). You can also view alerts in the [Notifications](optimization/notifications.md) tool and identify issues with third-party tracking pixels using the [Pixel Q&A](optimization/pixel-qa-tool.md) tool.
