# Bulk Tools {#bulk-tools}

Save time creating and editing placements using bulk tools.

## Attach Multiple Ads to Placements:{#attach-multiple-ads-to-placements}

Never attach the same ad one by one to multiple placements, or the same placement assigned one at a time to multiple ads ever again. Weâ€™ve now simplified the process so you can easily select multiple ads/placements to attach in bulk, saving you a significant amount of time and energy! Access this feature from the ad or placement section, via the gear on the right hand side.

>You can attach a maximum of 20 items at a time.

## Bulk Editing {#bulk-editing}

Reduce the amount of effort and clicks it takes to make changes across different placements. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, select "Bulk Edit," and choose the placements you'd like to change.
