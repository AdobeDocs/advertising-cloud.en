# Copy Placement Tool {#copy-placement-tool}

You can create a new placement by copying any placement in the Placements view:

* Copy placements across campaigns - either to a new campaign or an existing one
* Specify the number of times to copy a placement to a new or existing campaign
* Set the status of the copied placements (live, paused, etc) for easier management
* Choose whether or not to copy the ads attached to the original placement
* Modify the flight dates of the copied placements

[ ![copy placement](assets/copy-placement.jpg)](assets/copy-placement.jpg)

>[!NOTE]
>
>* No third-party pixels on any attached ads or placement are carried over if you are copying a placement to a new campaign.
>* This feature isn't available for BrandPoint GRP mode placements.
>* Nielsen pixels are applied to the new placement only if Nielsen is enabled on the destination campaign.
>* Custom weighting of ads are not attached.
>* Custom ad scheduling of placement flight dates are changed.
