# CPM Setup {#cpm-setup}

To set up a CPM placement watch our [video tutorial](https://education.tubemogul.com/videos/) or follow the steps below:

1. Select&nbsp;CPM Mode
1. In the top right corner, click on Edit Options

![CPM Mode](assets/cpm-mode.png)

*

    * Name your placement &nbsp;(Recommended Naming Convention: Test Campaign: GRP: PR15s: US )
    * Status: Choose whether the placement should begin right away or stay paused until you’ve confirmed all details.
    * Tags: Optional key words to help you search for your placement within the TubeMogul UI.
    * Pacing: Determine if you’d like to spend your daily placement budget evenly across 24 hours or as fast as possible within a couple of hours of the day. Fill as Fast as Possible accelerates delivery and is effective for placements with tight targeting parameters or short flight dates.
    * [Optimization Goals:](../../../user-guide/optimization/optimization-goals.md)&nbsp;Sites demonstrating strength in this metric will be favored during bidding
    * [Conversions](conversions.md): TubeMogul enables you to easily track conversions through our platform. It’s recommended to&nbsp; [create a conversion pixel](conversions.md)&nbsp;at least a week prior to campaign launch to ensure proper implementation and pixel firing. Once implemented, this is where you can enable the pixel on the placement level. Conversions can be any action performed by a viewer who was exposed to an ad such as returning to the brand site, signing up for a newsletter, inquiring for more information, etc.

1. Next, follow the steps below:

    * GOALS:

        * Audience Box: Check this box if you would like to run an on-target percentage campaign and receive&nbsp; [Nielsen DAR](../../../user-guide/measurement/nielsen-ocr-reporting.md)&nbsp;or [ComScore vCE](../../../user-guide/measurement/comscore-vce.md)&nbsp;reporting. Ask your Account Manager for details and refer to On Target Percentage placement set up ([OTP Setup](otp-setup.md)).
        
        * Goal Impressions: Set your target impression delivery goal.
        * Frequency Cap: &nbsp;select the number of types you want to reach a unique viewer. This will be the cap for the duration of the placement.

    *

        * BUDGET:&nbsp;Choose flight dates, options for [dayparting](../../../user-guide/planning/targeting/targeting-options.md), budget , Max Bid and&nbsp; [inventory tier](../../../user-guide/planning/brand-safety/sitesafe-quality.md).
        
        * LOCATION: Choose from 40+ countries. In most countries we can target down to state or province level. In the United States, we can target at the State, DMA and Zipcode level.
