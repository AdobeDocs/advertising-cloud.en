# VPAID JS {#vpaid-js}

* VPAID JavaScript inventory is available for desktop and mobile video
* The viewability measurement solution includes mobile video running on VPAID JavaScript inventory using the MRC standard
* IAS and MOAT viewability reporting encompasses mobile video if running on VPAID JavaScript

## Advised Actions

To ensure that you are maximizing scale and are delivering across both VPAID Flash and JavaScript inventory where available, here are our advised actions.

1st-Party / DSP Ads

All videos uploaded as interactive pre-roll are automatically converted to VPAID Flash and JavaScript. For overlays, it is recommended that an image is uploaded (e.g. JPEG, PNG, GIF). If a SWF/Flash file is uploaded, the ad will not be served into VPAID JavaScript  inventory.

3rd-Party Ads

Upload a single tag that references both VPAID Flash and JavaScript media files for maximum scale. Or, create two ads and upload a tag that references VPAID Flash and JavaScript media files separately (i.e., two tags). Advertising Cloud DSP will automatically deliver the acceptable asset based on the inventory type.

Hereâ€™s an example of the VPAID Flash and JS media file:

## Additional Best Practices:

* For overlays, only use image or JavaScript 3rd-party pixels, avoid using SWF/Flash-based files within the VPAID tag
* For [VPAID JavaScript](http://mkto-ab110051.com/Q0fP00F0J81c0043U00O000) and VAST creatives, use MP4 videos instead of FLV to ensure scale

## How to Run Video Ads on VPAID JavaScript Inventory

Placement Set-up

Select a :15s or :30s Interactive Pre-roll Placement - the placement will automatically deliver on desktop and mobile video VPAID Flash and JavaScript inventory, where available.

Note: If you would like to only target desktop or mobile video inventory in the platform, go to`Device Type targeting in the Placement Editor and select either Computer or Smartphone and Tablet.

Viewability Reporting

Under the Viewability Tab of the placement, TubeMogul metrics on the site level will include both desktop and mobile numbers. IAS and MOAT downloadable reports will also include desktop and mobile metrics, but reporting is currently blended since vendors are not separating out reporting by screen.
