# Ad Validator {#ad-validator}

The Ad Validator works across all ads within the platform, performing two types of validation:

* The Creative Review, which is a process that involves a specialized internal team that performs a series of qualitative checks, including watching the ad, ensuring it has the proper declared category and is ready to be viewed.

    * Available on ALL ads

* The Vast Validation process is a technical check performed by the platform to ensure that VAST tags return a response and that the minimum amount of mandatory fields are properly included (e.g. impressions or click macros).

    * Available on standard pre-roll desktop and mobile (VAST) as well as desktop interactive pre-roll (VPAID) ads

The platform will surface the approval process on the placement as well as ad level, making it easier to troubleshoot any broken ad. If an ad is not approved it will not bid on inventory until the ad is fixed.

Here are the different scenarios that will be surfaced based on the Creative Review and Vast Validation process:

All ads need to go through the Creative Review to be approved. For ads that are not bidding, here are suggested actions:

* Creative Review (not checked) - ensure it has been at least 24 hours since the time the ad was uploaded in the TubeMogul platform
* Creative Review (fail) - ensure the ad is not blank and the proper category was declared
* VAST Validation (fail) - ensure that the VAST is not blank and that it has the minimum mandatory nodes,

    * If a TubeMogul ad, reach out to your Account Manager to help troubleshoot
    * If a 3rd party ad, consult with your ad server to troubleshoot the tag for errors

If you have any questions, please reach out to your Account Manager or platform_support@tubemogul.com.
