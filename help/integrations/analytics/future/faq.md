By default, Adobe Analytics reports all captured events in every report. "[!UICONTROL Unspecified]" events represent form completion events that weren't connected to Advertising Cloud. For example, in the Ad Platform report, organic conversions or conversions driven by an email campaign would fall into "unspecified."

You can use the filter to remove unspecified events from reports by removing the check mark by “Include Unspecified (none)” option. <!-- Not sure if this is in DSP or in Analytics Workspace -->
