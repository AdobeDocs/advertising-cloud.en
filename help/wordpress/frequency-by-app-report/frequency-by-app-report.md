# Frequency By App Report {#frequency-by-app-report}

As viewers move seamlessly across channels, the ability to determine and optimize frequency to deliver the optimal viewing experience has become a crucial part of the advertising experience. To empower marketers with the right tools to manage frequency, we’ve built the Frequency by App report. In Custom Reports, marketers will be able to pull a report of the top 100 apps/sites they delivered on, to see impressions, frequency and unique delivery. Using this report, marketers can optimize away from publishers that are delivering high frequencies, shift to publishers with better unique reach and determine how their campaigns are performing across publishers. To navigate to this page, select Tools at the top of the page, and then Email Reports on the left side bar. From there you’ll be able to click on Frequency Report (By App/Site).

* App/Site Uniques – Total number of devices that we reached by this app
* App/Site Distinct Uniques – Total number of devices that were reached on this app only. If a viewer was exposed to an ad across multiple publishers they will not fall into this column/count. This count is specifically for viewers that were uniquely reached by this app.
* % Distinct Uniques - App/Site Distinct Uniques divided by App/Site Uniques
* Frequency – Impressions divided by App/Site Uniques
* Cost per Unique – Total Spend divided by App/Site Uniques
* Cost per Distinct Unique – Total Spend divided by App/Site Distinct Uniques
* Estimated Universe – Sum of unique householdss that our system (auctions) has seen within the date range

This report is determining unique reach by device, not user. `**Type of “devices”**`

1. Desktop and mobile web (as measured by a cookie)
1. Mobile app (as measured by mobile ID)
1. Connected TV (as measured by IP)

This report will aggregate reach across all devices. To get more granular reporting, apply a placement level filter under the Apply Filters section.
