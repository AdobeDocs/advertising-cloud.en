# Retargeting Pixel Setup {#retargeting-pixel-setup}

To create a retargeting pixel:

1. Click on Tools in the top navigation bar and select "SEGMENTS".

[ ![Segments](assets/segments.png)](assets/segments.png)
&nbsp;

2. &nbsp;Click on New Custom Segment and Name the segment. It should be something that clearly states what type of cookie pool you are collecting. For example: Homepage Visitors- Site X.
  
3. Click on the gear icon on the right side and select "get pixel". Use the HTML tag if you are placing it on a website and use the Flash tag if you are attaching it to an ad.

4. Use a Debugging tool such as Charles or Fiddler to doublecheck that the TubeMogul pixel is firing correctly.
  
5. &nbsp;Check the Segments section periodically to confirm Segment Size is increasing. &nbsp;You can also use this tool to manage the&nbsp;segments in your account.
