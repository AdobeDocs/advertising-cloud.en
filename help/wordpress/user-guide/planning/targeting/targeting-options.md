**Topic Targeting**

Topic targeting is another form of contextual targeting that allows you to target pages with content that is relevant to your audience. This type of targeting should only be applied to a small percentage of your overall buy given it may affect inventory availability. Activation of this feature will incur an additional CPM fee. Consult your Account Manager if you are interested in getting a list of topics available.
