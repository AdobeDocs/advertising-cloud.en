# BrandPoint {#brandpoint}

BrandPoint is the simplest and most cost effective way to buy video advertising using&nbsp;Gross Rating Points (GRPs). BrandPoint enables brand marketers to plan, buy and measure digital video on a comparable basis to TV. For the first time, advertisers can execute verifiable and optimized delivery to online populations –&nbsp;dynamically.&nbsp; BrandPoint buys media in real-time, to reach a client’s desired audience. &nbsp; [Nielsen](../user-guide/measurement/nielsen-ocr-reporting.md)&nbsp;and&nbsp; [Comscore](../user-guide/measurement/comscore-vce.md)&nbsp;validated reporting are&nbsp;also available within the TubeMogul dashboard to measure and verify delivery.

Media buyers are looking to supplement their TV buys with online video, but they need a reliable and simple platform for buying and executing a GRP buy. BrandPoint will not only accurately predict a buy, but also uses proprietary data targeting to provide the best Cost Per Point in the industry.

**How Does BrandPoint Work&nbsp;**

&nbsp;

**How is Cost Per Point Calculated**
TubeMogul uses proprietary data targeting to improve on-target % throughout the campaign.&nbsp;BrandPoint calculates the Cost Per Point using several different factors:

* Sites: TubeMogul indexes their inventory using Nielsen OCR and Facebook-based user data. These two methods provide BrandPoint site-level demographic breakdowns for our inventory.
* Audience Data: Our machine learning team creates large pools of users and maps them to age and gender combinations. These pools of users are created using look-alike modeling based on validated truth sets. We test this data using Nielsen OCR and create a database of on-target percentages for each pool of users. The data is then applied to campaigns bought on a CPP.
* Inventory Cost: BrandPoint has historical auction data of expected cost of inventory from TubeMogul's billions of auctions we see on a daily basis.

Our tool combines the above data points to calculate the Cost Per Point of a campaign. The process takes the following steps:

1. BrandPoint determines how many impression you'll be able to buy given your budget and targeting parameters
1. BrandPoint calculates how many of those impressions will be on target. This blends both the site demographics data and the audience segment data together.
1. BrandPoint calculates how many GRP's your plan will achieve using the digital GRP formula.

**How to Calculate a Digital GRP**
There are different ways of calculating digital GRP, depending on the medium and approach. Below is the formula BrandPoint uses to calculate GRP:   
* GRP =     `Total impression * On-Target%`*
  
*&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Natural Population&nbsp;*
  
Natural Population refers to your total target population. For example, if you are targeting Female 25-54 in the US, the population number you would use is 62.8M. If you were targeting a specific DMA, the population number would be based on that DMA.&nbsp;To maintain consistency with Nielsen TV GRP calculations, "Natural Population" is using overall population rather than online audiences only.
