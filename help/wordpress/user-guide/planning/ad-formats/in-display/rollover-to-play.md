# Rollover to Play {#rollover-to-play}

[ ![ROTP](assets/rotp3.png)](assets/rotp3.png)
**Player Action:**

* Video served with a “Rollover to Play” call-to-action over center of video - a “rollback” corner is available if desired
* When viewers rollover unit, the video plays with sound on after a 3 second countdown - eliminating accidental rollover

**Benefits:**

* Delivers engaged viewers who choose to watch your video
* Add branded overlays and sharing buttons to drive user actions and ensure brand association
* Add a video teaser to entice viewers to click on your ad
* Broad reach and lower pricing
* Content can be any length (< 2 min recommended)

**Considerations:**

* Nice complement to pre-roll campaigns
* Low CPMs can help increase margin
* Playrates (views/impressions): 0.6-1.0%

**Recommended Pricing Model:**

* [CPV](../user-guide/planning/ad-formats/performance-pricing.md)
