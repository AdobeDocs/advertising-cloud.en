[ ![mediaquality](assets/mediaquality-1024x639.png)](assets/mediaquality.png) **`Fraud Prevention`** To minimize non-human traffic, TubeMogul detects and blocks traffic coming from bots to ensure campaigns are seen by a real human. TubeMogul's fraud prevention measures include: [ ![mediaquality2](assets/mediaquality2.png)](assets/mediaquality2.png) ***NHT Credit Program ***offers advertisers that are participating in TubeMogul's Non-Human Traffic Credit Program automatically receive refunds for video ad impressions served on open exchange inventory that a 3rd party verification company, White Ops, has measured and identified as fraudulent. This protection can be enabled at no additional cost. Contact your account manage for more information!   `**Brand Safety**` TubeMogul protects ads from not only inappropriate content, but also environments that don't align with your campaign and brand image. By defining brand inappropriate content, TubeMogul gives advertisers full control over which pages or apps their ads run on. *TubeMogul's preventative measures include:*

* Site and app level screening by a specialized team who reviews media quality content, excluding any unsafe inventory (e.g. pirated content, malicious content, etc.). The screening and ranking of these sites into tiers give advertisers&nbsp;the control to choose where they want their campaigns to run:

    * Tier 1: Brand name sites that an advertiser would recognize and perceive as high quality (e.g. ESPN, Forbes)
    * Tier 2: Professional, quality sites that have heavy traffic, but lesser known or local channels (e.g. CBS.com/sanfrancisco)
    * Tier 3: Niche, reach sites that are brand safe and great for reach (e.g. ReceipeLand)
