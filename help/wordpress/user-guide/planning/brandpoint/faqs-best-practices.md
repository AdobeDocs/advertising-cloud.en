# FAQs & Best Practices {#faqs-best-practices}

**Best Practices:**

* While a traditional TV buyer is accustomed to buying media with a frequency target, in the digital world we are accustomed to frequency capping. When planning a buy in BrandPoint, it’s important to keep in mind that if you have a certain frequency target, you may need to select a higher frequency cap than your frequency target in order to hit the average.
* Set your budget appropriately. In BrandPoint, just like in TV the budget amount drives the projected GRP.
* Targeting – although our audience segments as well as our site tool can increase the on-target %, they also constrain the amount of inventory that can be bought. Therefore, keep your site list as expansive as possible and focus on creating parameters based on quality of sites vs. cherry-picking the inventory.
* The higher (lower quality) Tiers you select, the lower your cost per point.
* Selecting high on-target % sites may not result in a lower Cost Per Point. It depends on whether the relative increase in cost is higher or lower than the relative increase in on-target impressions.
* Increasing frequency caps will drive cost per point down.

**FAQs:**

1. What are the benefits of using BrandPoint?

    1. BrandPoint is the simplest solution to plan, buy and measure video based GRPs. It provides brand marketers a fast and accurate platform to execute digital video campaigns in a comparable way to television.

1. How much does it cost to use BrandPoint?

    1. BrandPoint predicts the CPP based on your campaign parameters. We do not charge for Nielsen OCR or the data used to ensure high on-target percentages and low CPP.

1. Are your rates lower than TV?

    1. The answer depends on what you are buying on TV versus digital. For example, primetime rates on TV are very expensive with high CPPs but it's also possible to buy much lower cost cable, syndication and overnight TV inventory. In general, our DMA-targeted rate are lower than TV.

1. How does BrandPoint work to ensure high on-target percentages?

    1. Our system seeks out targeted audiences by combining two important data sources:

        * First, we create large pools of users that map to Nielsen age and gender populations using look-a-like modeling.
        * Second, we index each site in our system to Nielsen OCR by running media on that site and measuring results from OCR.
        * Our tool then combines these data points and adjusts them according to your BrandPoint campaign plan. We continually measure, validate and refine these algorithms to increase on-target percentages.

1. How are sites scored/indexed for on-target percentage?

    1. We score the site based on the match rate we see to a particular demo. Our proprietary modeling uses historical campaign data combined with the demo matching we perform against Nielsen on an "always-on" basis.

1. How is GRP calculated?

    1. GRP = reach&#42;/total in- target population x frequency x 100
    1. Reach = all unique impressions &#42; on-target percentage

1. Do you use Internet population of an audience for purposes of calculating GRP?

    1. This tool as well as Nielsen defines the in-target population as the entire population of the country, instead of just the online audiences.

1. Which ad units are supported by this tool?

    1. Pre-Roll
    1. Interactive Pre-Roll
    1. Skippable Pre-Roll
    1. Click to Play
    1. Rollover to Play
    1. Branded Autoplay
    1. Full screen Expandable
    1. Social Media Click to Play

1. Is BrandPoint available in my market?

    1. BrandPoint is available with Nielsen OCR reporting in the United States,&nbsp;United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, Germany, France, and Australia.&nbsp; It's also available with TubeMogul GRP reporting in the countries listed below.   
       Countries Currently Available:

       Japan, Singapore, Belgium, China, Denmark, Finland, Brazil, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Republic of Ireland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam.

       &nbsp;
       Please contact us for expected availability in other countries.

1. Why isn’t the DMA I want available through BrandPoint? When will it be available?

    1. Nielsen OCR reporting is currently only available in the 30 largest DMAs in the United States.&nbsp; We will continue to add DMAs as they become available through Nielsen OCR.

1. How are you able to report on sites where Nielsen OCR isn’t available?

    1. Our system compares the audience composition of each site we serve ads on.&nbsp; We then find properties that have a similar audience composition to that site and base the prediction on those figures.

1. In TV I buy a frequency target, you have a frequency cap.&nbsp; What’s the difference?

    1. Unlike TV, you can guarantee that one online user will see an ad no more than a specified amount of times.&nbsp; Reach and frequency, therefore, can be more accurately measured.&nbsp; If you have a certain average frequency in mind, it may be beneficial to raise the frequency cap to hit that average amount.

1. How long does it take to index my private marketplace / direct buy sites?

    1. New private ad feeds will typically be available in the tool within 24 hours.&nbsp; However, the indexing process requires us to first run media through the feed to evaluate the site’s demographics, so it can sometimes take several days to index a site.

1. Is there a difference between a TV and digital GRP?

    1. The calculation is the same – and in the case of BrandPoint, both are validated by Nielsen data.&nbsp; However, one might argue that a digital GRP is more valuable since the viewer has to initiate each video view (whereas most research suggests only 50% of people are actually watching the TV when it is on).&nbsp; Also, frequency caps can’t be set on TV.

1. Aren’t we going back in time by using GRPs in digital?

    1. No, all of the other metrics we capture like completion rates, engagements, clicks and conversions are still available.&nbsp; GRP measurement is simply used to enable cross-media planning and measurement across TV and digital video.

1. If I want to run in locations not available in BrandPoint, should I run the campaign under “CPM Mode”?

    1. Yes, but GRP and CPP planning, buying and reporting will not be available in CPM mode.

1. How are projected GRPs, on-target CPM and CPP calculated?

    1. Projected GRPs = (total impressions &#42; on-target %) / natural population
    1. CPM = effective CPM / on-target %
    1. CPP = (effective CPM &#42; natural population) / on-target %
