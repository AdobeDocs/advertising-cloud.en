# On Demand Placement {#on-demand-placement}

Now that you've gained access to all the On Demand premium publishers you'd like to work with, we've created a placement that allows you to target all that inventory at once. `Feature Set Up`

* Navigate to the "Inventory Sources" section of a placement and click on the "Optimize to use On Demand Inventory only" box.

    * Ensure that Public Inventory is unchecked and that Private Inventory is selected

* The platform will then prompt you to confirm the site targeting. To maximize scale and performance, we recommend selecting "Add All Sites".

[ ![ondemand3](assets/ondemand3.png)](assets/ondemand3.png)

* Either selection will move you to the site tool to confirm the list of sites. Once you've done that, save & close.

[ ![ondemand4](assets/ondemand4.png)](assets/ondemand4.png)   `Things to Note`:

* **Max Bid**: When using this feature, the placement will automatically populate a default CPM to clear the most expensive feed (or inventory source). This max bid is only a suggestion. If the price is too high, feel free to adjust to the necessary price point. To get a range of different inventory sources and maximize the diversity of delivery, create multiple On Demand placements with different max bids.
* **Location**:&nbsp;This is just a reminder to be sure to select the appropriate geography on your placement.
