# Feed Reporting {#feed-reporting}

On the main feed management page, you can access more than 30 metrics, ranging from impressions and costs, to completion rates and click throughs to conversions, broken out by publisher and feed. **Where to find it** Navigate to the Private Inventory section at the top menu bar. Then click on the 'Analytics' tab on the left hand menu. [ ![privateive](assets/privateive.png)](assets/privateive.png) The metrics you see onscreen and in the exports will be for the date range you specify on the top left of the page.&nbsp;To change the metrics displayed on screen, click on the metric list&nbsp;icon next to the Options column on the top right.To see all metrics at once, you can export all of the data to Excel for both the active and archived feeds sections, by clicking the “Export ” button at the bottom right or the Excel Icon on the top right. &nbsp; [ ![Feed reporting](assets/feed-reporting.png)](assets/feed-reporting.png)&nbsp; **See Report&nbsp;** 
At the individual feed level, if you click on the gear icon and &nbsp;from the drop down menu, select “See Report” , you will see more detailed reporting by feed. Here you can see all of the same metrics as you did on the main page by clicking on the data icon, but you can also view and export reporting by Advertiser, Campaign, Ad Type and Site. You can also get private feed reporting via customized&nbsp; [Email Reports](../user-guide/measurement/campaign-reporting/email-reports/user-guidemeasurementcampaign-reportingemail-reports.md).
