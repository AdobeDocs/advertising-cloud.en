# Brand Safety {#brand-safety}

We've integrated multiple layers of brand protection to ensure that your video ads never run beside content unworthy of your brand. Each component of BrandSafe acts as a barrier between your video ad and unsavory websites:&nbsp; [SiteSafe](sitesafe-quality/user-guideplanningbrand-safetysitesafe-quality.md),&nbsp; [PageSafe](pagesafe-proximic/user-guideplanningbrand-safetypagesafe-proximic.md)&nbsp;and&nbsp; [PlaySafe](playsafe-fake-pre-roll/user-guideplanningbrand-safetyplaysafe-fake-pre-roll.md). [Blacklists](/user-guide/execution/blacklists/)&nbsp;can also be applied at the account or advertiser level.
