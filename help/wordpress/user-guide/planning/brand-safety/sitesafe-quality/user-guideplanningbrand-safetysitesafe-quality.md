# SiteSafe (Quality) {#sitesafe-quality}

Every site accessed by our buying platform has been manually screened by a dedicated team and ranked into tiers by quality. Advertisers can choose which quality tiers they want to run on. The guidelines for each tier:

* Tier 1:&nbsp;Brand name sites that an advertiser will recognize and perceive as high quality (e.g. ESPN, Forbes)
* Tier 2:&nbsp;Professional, quality sites, but an advertiser might not be as familiar with them (e.g. eHow, CafeMom)
* Tier 3:&nbsp;Niche, long-tail sites that are brand safe and great for reach (e.g. RecipeLand)
* Untiered: This bucket refers to sites that we have access to, but have yet to tier. Use this if you are looking for additional reach or &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; scale.
