# Connected TV Setup {#connected-tv-setup}

**Create a New Ad**

* Click on Ads on the left hand menu bar
* Select New Ad in the top right corner and select Pre-roll: Connected TV unit and duration you'd like to run. Keep in mind that the the duration of the ad will affect inventory&nbsp;availability.

**Upload the Video**

* Upload Video: Raw creative asset. See&nbsp; [Ad Specs.](../user-guide/planning/ad-formats/ad-specs.md)
* Use Existing Video: Use a previously uploaded video to create a new ad.

**Configure the Ad**

* Basic: Name your ad. No clickthrough functionality available for this unit.
* [Pixel:](3rd-party-tracking-adserving/tracking-pixels.md)Add in any 3rd party tracking pixels. Note that all Connected TV pixels **should not be SSL compliant** as SSL compliant pixels on Connected TV will cause large discrepancies between your 3rd party ad-server reporting and TubeMogul's platform reporting.

**Save & Submit for Review**
  
TubeMogul's [ad review](ad-reviews.md) team verifies that the ad is rendering properly. Approval time is typically 2-4 hours on regular business hours and 24hrs on weekends.
