# Launch Checklist {#launch-checklist}

Make sure your account has enough credit to run the entire placement. You can refill and check funding in the “My Account” section in the upper right hand corner or&nbsp;contact your Account Manager&nbsp;for a higher credit limit.

**Campaign Status**
Confirm that the Advertiser URL and Campaign Budget Cap are correct.

**Placement Status&nbsp;**
Make sure the placement is set to live (green) in the Placement dashboard.&nbsp;Check your placement parameters (site list, budget, goal, flight dates, frequency etc) and verify that they are correct.

**Ad Status**
Click on the Ad button underneath the placement title and check that ads are attached, approved and live.

**Pixels**
Go to your ads, click on the pixel tab and verify that the pixels are “Attached” and firing. [Download](https://drive.google.com/a/tubemogul.com/file/d/0B9PHgqCrqvaBLWxlX3hmdHBhOEk/view?usp=sharing)&nbsp;a campaign launch check list for your Media Traders
