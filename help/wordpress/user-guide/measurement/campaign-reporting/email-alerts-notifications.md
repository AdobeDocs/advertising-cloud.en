**Why it is useful:**

With Email Alerts & Notifications, users will be able to set up subscriptions to receive email alerts regarding their account & campaign progress and status.

**When to use:**

If you are not actively checking campaign reporting within the platform, itâ€™s best practice to set up email reports as soon as possible after a campaign has launched.
**What it currently does not do:**

* Does not send alerts on any performance level data
* Does not email you any recent placement changes to max bids, budgets or status
