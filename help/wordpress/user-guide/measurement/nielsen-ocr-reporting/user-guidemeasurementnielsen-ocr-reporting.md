# Nielsen DAR Reporting {#nielsen-dar-reporting}

TubeMogul has partnered with Nielsen to offer audience verification reporting also known as Digital Ad&nbsp;Rating (DAR). &nbsp;This reporting is available when you utilize the&nbsp; [BrandPoint](../user-guide/planning/brandpoint/user-guideplanningbrandpoint.md)&nbsp;or by enabling Nielsen at the campaign level. Campaign level reporting will enable reporting on every placement in the campaign while creating a Brandpoint placement will only enable Nielsen reporting on that placement. **Where to Access Reporting&nbsp;** Reporting can be accessed by clicking on the placement title or the gear icon on the right of the page and selecting See Report. Once you are in the&nbsp; [Full Report](../user-guide/measurement/campaign-reporting/full-report/user-guidemeasurementcampaign-reportingfull-report.md)&nbsp;section, click on the Demographics tab to view your Audience Reporting data for that placement. [ ![GRP reporting](assets/grp-reporting.png)](assets/grp-reporting.png) **Metrics Available**

* Placement On-target Percentage:&nbsp;The percentage of total impressions delivered within the audience target of the campaign.
* Cost Per Point: The cost per grp point achieved for the audience target of this campaign
* GRP:&nbsp;The Gross Ratings Point measures the size of the audience for the online ad campaign, calculated as the product of the Audience Reach and the Average Frequency. This metric is comparable to television ratings.
* Gender Distribution: The gender distribution breakdown for the impressions delivered on this campaign or placement.
* Unique Audience:&nbsp;The unique count of individuals exposed to the online ad campaign.
* Average Frequency:&nbsp;The average number of times each unique audience member was exposed to the ad(s) in the campaign.
* Impressions:&nbsp;Count of individual ad exposures. This number may be slightly lower than Tubemogul ad server impressions count due to the nature of third-party tagging. Impressions are counted when the Nielsen tag initiates at the time of the ad rendering.
* Impressions % Share:&nbsp;The share of the total online impressions as represented for a given demographic group
* Audience Reach %:&nbsp;The population base that was reached by the campaign.
* On Target CPM: The cost to delivery 1000 impressions to the audience target of this campaign or placement
