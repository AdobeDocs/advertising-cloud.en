## Optimize on Metrics You Care About {#optimize-on-metrics-you-care-about}

&nbsp;
TubeMogul automatically adjusts spend to sites&nbsp;that deliver the metrics you care about most, ensuring your dollars are spent efficiently to achieve your goals. Once a campaign starts, TubeMogul's optimization technology kicks in, powered by over four years of video analytics insight. Utilizing real-time metrics like second-by-second engagement, social network sharing and completions, TubeMogul automatically shifts spending to audiences where the ad is generating the greatest impact.   
Within our platform we offer two types of optimization:
