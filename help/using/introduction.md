# About Adobe Advertising Cloud Creative

Adobe Advertising Cloud Creative is a self-service platform for automating real-time, personalized ad experiences.

## Rules-based experiences

With Advertising Cloud Creative, you can build out stories using a rules-based decision tree model, unfolding a thoughtfully-sequenced string of ads that takes your customers on a journey and follows them even when they move to different websites or devices. The stories can change based on customer behavior, geography, demographics, retargeting, position in the customer journey, and more.

## Adobe content and data integrations

Advertising Cloud Creative has direct integrations with Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Experience Manager, allowing you to easily upload the Adobe assets that your design team creates and use them for real-time storyboarding and editing of ad experiences. 

You also can use your first-party audience segments from Adobe Audience Manager and Adobe Analytics — as well as audience segments you create in Advertising Cloud DSP or retargeting pixels you create using Advertising Cloud Creative — as targets for specific creatives in an ad experience.

## Implementation of experiences as ads

Once you create an experience, you can generate a JavaScript or iframe tag for the experience and implement it as a third-party ad in Advertising Cloud DSP or any other DSP.

## Performance reporting

Besides viewing detailed, experience-level performance reports, you can also create custom reports to monitor performance across your experiences.
