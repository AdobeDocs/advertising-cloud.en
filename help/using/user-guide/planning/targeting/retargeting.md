# Retargeting {#retargeting}

Our Custom Segments feature allows you to [create a retargeting pixel](retargeting/retargeting-pixel-setup.md)within your TubeMogul account to collect your own first party audience data.
This feature is used in a few different ways:

* Retargeting site visitors&nbsp;– create a retargeting pixel at least 2 weeks prior to the campaign start date and place the pixel on the brand's website.&nbsp; The pixel fires when the page is loaded and stores a cookie pool of website visitors.
* Retargeting video viewers&nbsp;– create a pixel and attach it to a currently live video or display ad. The pixel fires upon a view and stores a cookie pool of ad viewers.
* Creating cookie pools&nbsp;– create and add pixels to video ads to create groups of video viewers across campaigns, for example, “Auto video viewers”, “holiday video viewers”, etc.
* Identifying control and exposed groups for [surveys](../../../user-guide/planning/brandsights.md)– create a pixel and attach it to all video ads in a campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp; This enables you to identify the “exposed” group, the viewers who have been exposed to the online video campaign.
