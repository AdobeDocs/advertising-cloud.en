# Planning in GRP Mode {#planning-in-grp-mode}

The below will teach you how to use your GRP planning tool to project Cost Per Point (CPP), On-Target CPM and On-Target Percentage based on your GRP goal and budget for a particular campaign plan:

1. Click New Placement
1. Select type of Ad Unit
1. Make sure you are in BrandPoint View/ GRP Mode
1. Set your Goals: Audience Target, GRP Goal, Frequency Cap
1. Budget: Set your flight dates and Budget and Inventory Tier (1-3 or all recommended given this is an audience buy)
1. Set your target location
1. Take a look at the Fill Estimator chart on the right to see estimated costs and on target percentage.

    * If you started off with a GRP goal, to figure out the budget needed to fill this goal, slide the Budget bar until it intersects with the GRP goal

**Other Targeting Filters are Also Available**

* You can still filter by specific Public Inventory, Private Inventory or Other Filters such as Day parting, Device Targeting, Audience Targeting etc.
